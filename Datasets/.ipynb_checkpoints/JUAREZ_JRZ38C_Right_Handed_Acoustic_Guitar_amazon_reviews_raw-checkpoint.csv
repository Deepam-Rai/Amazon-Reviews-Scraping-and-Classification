"Nice product received 👌, good for beginners",4
"If you are a beginner go for it for this price i think it's the best, sound quality is mid but what do you really expect, would recommend to upgrade the strings if you want better sounding guitar",5

 Sound quality is pretty good. I got the desirous one and this is first guitar 🥰",4
Good,3
Sound is better than other guitars which are even comparatively higher in price.. but i can't say its just my luck or the product is really good.. but the product i got is better than 5k 7k guitars..,5
Very good guitar in this range and good  for beginners,4

"This is not a professional guitar. For beginners. I  highly recommend it as it has a good finish, good quality strings and good sound.",5
Sound quality was great. For beginners this is a great one to have,5
Good,5
If you want to buy a guitar for long run and professional future... Sorry to say this is not the one you are searching for. This is only for those want a guitar for taking photos or just to try guitar.,3

 I have bought this few days back and trust the makers I am amazed to see such a beautiful guitar at a price under 2K..It's the Sound.Well I have played a lot of guitars over the years and it all comes down to the sound quality of the guitar and the buzz in the strings when you play it either concert or in a studio. And the response from this guitar is just beautiful as it looks. The stock string sound deliciously melodious and no distuning feel to it.Who is it for?It's for beginners. BUT. What the heck it's for all.I mean if you play chords until the 12 fret it's comfortable and as I said the sound is on point. To learning it is made for but the sound can be worth for studios.Long term.I am sorry. I don't know how it may lead to a long term investment. But if you take care of it it will just take care of the sound for you. And come on it's like 1800 rupees. Enjoy and play.What can you play.RiffsChordsSlideLead (anything after 12 fret is up to how good you are without your thumb as there isn't any cut)TappingSweep picking.I bought it for my friend who is a beginner. I suggest it's worth every penny and maybe more.",5
,3
It's good for beginner... sound output is also good,4
liked the product but not satisfied as the neck or fretboard is very rough which can lead to chapped skin on fingers,3
"If you are a true beginer then you should go for it...Sound quality of guitar is not that good as i have bought for my nephew.. i use yamaha f310 so i dont like its sound..Tuning pegs are lil firm and feels like descent plastic material..I should suggest , if you are a beginer dont know much then u should go for it...",3
Its a great guitar for beginners at a really great price but I would suggest you if you really are interested in learning guitar then you should spend some more money and get a yamha one or a kadence which are high quality. The worst thing about this guitar was that the strings were of very cheap quality. I had to change them and you can see them in the pic.  Overall sound quality is also good.,3
"Well, this is my 2nd guiter that is Juarez 38C, i bought the same guiter a year ago, it was like super guiter to me as i was just a beginer back in those days, but this time i ordered the same one just to gift some one and the guiter i got has too many SCRATCH all over it's body and it has a visible DENT on it's back, needlessly or shamelessly the guiter sounds really good. It feels like somebody has already used it.Theres a REQUEST in this REVIEW:: Please have a look at it, when we buy something from a seller we keep our own FANTASY for that item, we should not say ""disgusting"".VALUE FOR MONEY I say.. thanks.",5
Good product but damage on neck joint,4
Juarez is cheat me maine sun burst color guitar order kiya tha but wrong color bhej diya Reuter karne ke baad na hi mera refund aaya or na hi kore products bheja coustermer care main call karo to bolte h hum aapki koee help nahi kar sakte h,1
All items not send this picture why,1
"Guitar is light weight and value for money but i have problem with string... after delivery of guitar,2 strings break after 1 hour but they also give extra strings so its not a big problem..guitar sound is great and overall its good for you if you are beginner",4
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The guitar has excellent looks and a great design for such a cheap price but the distance between the fretboard and the strings is very high, due to it the fingers of the player hurt a lot and it becomes difficult to play. I would not recommend to buy it, especially not as a beginners guitar (as it has high action). The guitar I received has some cracks on the neck due to which it might not last more that 4-5 months even only if you handle it with care every time you play it. My recommendation is that if you have a fine budget do not buy this.",3
Nice one,4
This product's delivery was super awesome..no any scratch..and..it's has good sound quality and easy comfort for handling..go for it if u r beginner,4
It's survived all this time... They give u extra strings too.... Its for basic practise and nothing else....... If u want to start learning guitar best bet is this... But sound quality is trash and very fast gets out of tune hence need to tune it regularly...... Sometime carry over vibrations can change the note u are playing but that's what u would expect out of cheap guitar... But for beginners who don't know whether u are going to continue or not this toy is ideal... Solid 7/10,4
"Good only for beginners when you don't understand the basics of playing a guitar.The gap between the frets and the strings is quite big and you realise this only after 2-3 months and on playing other good guitars.Half your concentration goes in managing this gap and getting the right tone for the note you are pressing. This is a design defect of the frets and this defeats the purpose of playing a guitar, especially when you start learning to play tunes.Recommended only for beginners and that too for 3-4 months only.",3
It's a good quality guitar for beginners.The guitar is not tuned and hence you have to tune it on your own. Otherwise I am quite satisfied,4
"First of all the guitar isn’t that big as you might think. It’s suitable for kids and teens.The sound is okay.. the strings not so.I bought this guitar a couple of months ago but after a few sessions, the string broke and the gap between the fretboard and the string grew more and more. Planning to sell it soon lol",2
"Its the best Guitar for beginners.. Sound quality is awesome... Packaging of this guitar was so rough.  Luckily i got an unbroken one.... Otherwise it would have been broken if i say about packaging.  But its a cute , small and beautiful guitar for someone who wants to play it for the very first time..  i love it..",4
Guitar is in good condition though packaging was not that careful. However better for beginners so learn and grow....welcome to the new community of guitarist...and those who love music...,4
Advantages:- Good choice of beginner 1-2 year tak use kar sakte ho after learning then you can buy a new one.Disadvantages:- the body of guitar is not of as hard wood as the fretboard . The fretboard is having a great quality,4
Strings are of not so good quality. This guitar iS very sensitive.,4
Buy only for practice and not for professional.Decent product..,3
I will only say that you get what you pay for. The built of the guitar is pretty good and you won't be disappointed with it. I can't say much about the sound quality as I am a beginner but I think it is just fine for someone who is just starting to learn guitar.,4
There are apps available to tune the guitar and it’s easy as well. Once tuned it sounds good.Build quality is ok at this price point. A musical instrument at this price point is a very good proposition for beginners.,4
I have buyed nearly 20 - 25 guitar but this is super incredible ! You must buy it. It's theBest guitar if you see it's price its very reasonable may God bless Juarez brand.,5
Best product for beginners..value for money…,4
Good but small,4
"It's all cool.... Beautiful sound and all... But is a lil brittle, it cracked near the hole when I dropped it for the first time, thought sound remained un affected. So if u wanna buy a budget guitar with good acoustics, this one's good to go, with a cautious use.",3
Good for first  timer,4
Good for beingners sound quality also good in this price range I got this at 1690 in Amazon sale 4 star for finishing is not good from some sides but overall good use it 5-6 month then you but another if you feel that you are passionate about guiterEasily you can buy so cheap then you Learn from that and buy another when you got some perfect knowledge,4
"The Guitar is Just woww.... The strings are of copper and metal picks are designed and beautifully coloured, the strap is of fit size. (Amazing Purchase from the house of Juarez , and thanks amazon for this brilliant product.1.Good for beginners.2.sound quality is average(good in that price).presentation is good but quality is average.After noticing all features ithint that you should go for it.",4
"Guitar:Quality is Good. Value for MoneyColor Finishing is Awesome.Packaging was Very Good.Delivery was Lightning Fast.This Guitar is Small for Adults. It Has Long Scales For Finger Straching ExercerciesSuitable for Kids 10-18 yr Only.This Guitar is Only Replaceable, No Option to Return.Guitar Bag:Made of Thin Material. Not Paded not be Able to Protect the Guitar while Traveling, But Good for Just Storing it in Home.Strap:It is Good for the Price Point of the Guitar.",4
"Got in hand as shown in image. As i'm an absolute beginner, haven't found any damage in the piece. Sound quality is good. A masterpiece for beginners at negotiable rate",4
"I thought it would be delivered broken to me,but packaging was very good.I dont think this is for beginners as action is too high but overall anyone should not expect anything good in this price.",3
,3
Avarage quality packaging not good,2
"Although the make is good and it looks pretty. The piece that I got had rusted strings. Have ordered a replacement, but now I’m worried that the strings will rust in future.Update, got the replaced item but still worried that the strings will rust in future.",4
very good,3
"A definitely good start for absolute beginners. Since you are getting too much for less price, I am not gonna talk about quality but if you just wanna start learning during the lockdown and buy a good guitar, later on, this one is probably a good choice.",4
"It has fret buzz, mainly due to the strings which are not so good. You need to change the strings to high quality ones to reduce that. The action is also a lot. But overall it's a great guitar for beginners.",4
Learning guitar is all about time.. It's easy to learn but you need a good guitar to start your learning.. Juarez is pocket friendly guitar but the sound is pathetic and even if you play the chords correctly you will hear a different song from the one you are playing. use it harshly to learn and get a new guitar once comfortable.,3
"It's good at this price point but as a beginner it becomes difficult to learn barre chords. You will need to change it's strings,ig, in order to make it possible to barre chords.",4
Caution : Don't tighten the strings beyond safe limits.....,4
It's ok for beginners. But tuning pegs are very weak as they are plastic and a peg got off when trying to tune. Little difficult adjustment in keeping the tune in perfection. Anyhow we are enjoying playing it.,4
"We have guitars available of a larger size, but this one is perfect for those who are learning, the pitch of this is quite high, and is loud as well.In terms of durability, I personally think material of the body provided should be taken into consideration.The bag provided along with could have been of a better quality, but those things come secondary.Good for beginners.",4
Can't complain with this price you can't get more than thisBtw amazing productExactly same as it is appears on the siteSound quality not up to that mark but can't complain as it is best value for money,4
the whole packaging was really good nd the product is very nice no manufacturing defect.....little bit is there but overall Product is value of money......even the sound Quality very nice nd its never feel us that product was cheap.......,4
Only for beginners but there was no defect in the product which was great sound quality seems fine for me not that great but for price point it’s good. You should try it out,4
Good product timely delivered,4
"Guitar look much prettier than any pictures of it so I'm not posting any images, love that red and black colour combination its perfect. I was worried about its damage but not a single scratch was their in the guitar as because of the perfect packaging only thing is the bag is very thin its just for protecting the guitar from dust and stain not from damages and scratches but in this budget its genuine thanks amazon",5
String are of very low quality.String broken in first tuning.I tried spare string which was available in bag.That also broken 😔,3
"I am writing this review after using it for2mnths, and its a nice deal, u ll gt accessories as well, though my string gt broken in a month ,you ll gt what u have paid soo u shud not expect a fender or yamaha quality sound.-Nxt comes the luks, its bst in look wise glossy finish looks similar to to any high end guitar, except the size which is a bit small.- One can move to an high end guitar after practising on this as its the lowest price.-Guitar have to be tuned more frequently and their is more gap in between strings and guitar bridge .- it doesn't even comes with a truss rod so their is an high chance of bending of the neck.If you find the review helpful plz click on helpful button😊😊",3
Nice products,3
Overall the guitar is good and enough satisfying product probably in this price range. And nothing more could be expected in this price . But the straps and bag are of somewhat poor quality,4
This guitar is good just for kids. Even if you are beginner then also you should not go for this product because will have desire to learn only if sound will be good. Sound is not good. So i would suggest to go for little costly guitars.,3
Am a beginner and I loved it I got the product in good condition am happy about that otherwise I was worried seeing some ppl received broken ones I love playing this guitar happy so far 👍,3
Good 👍,4
Everything is good at this price range....Beginner should go for this.....But their is some damage in the front side edge of the guitar on the body below the bridge.....Overall great guitar at this price range and als the strap is too small....,5
"I bought it in rs 2190. The packaging was in cardboard box and delivered via car. I received nice product. Sound is very good. You have to tune the guitar (can do it by downloading guitar tuna app from playstore). They have given a guitar bag, extra strings (string number not mentioned in packet) and plectrum. There is no port to input electric chord to play the guitar in amplifier.Nice product. I will definitely recommend it.",5
"good guitar for begginers, action is too high so guitarist who have experience should stay away from it. bass string gets out tune after some time play but thats the only problem overall its a good guitar..",4
Better,4
"Sound quality is good not excellent but at this price, you won't get better than this.Once you learn the guitar, you can go for higher price guitars. To start this is the best.Packaging was good.",4
Very beautiful in looks....Sound quality is good....Very good for beginners....Very good guitar in budget segment....,4
"Everything was just perfect, but only lapse is that last string is very loose on guitar that's allAdvise me on how to fix itThanks",4
Any way it's look so very nice and good for beginners but prefer to get good one in it,5
Oke,4
The guitar is nice . Only the sound buzz .I would like to suggest to the seller that please do something of this buzzing sound.,4
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Considering the given price point, the product quality is good. But I would definitely not reccomend this guitar to any begginer as the action is way too high. A begginer wouldn't even know about the action. As there is no truss rod so the action can not be fixed. A begginer would definitely loose interest because of the high action cause playing with such high action isn't a good practice, needs a lot more useless pressure by the fingers and is never advised.",2
"Difficult for beginners to play,unless manufacturers need to reduce the play (Pressing distance between Fret and String) so fingers can press properly.If the above if fixed, It will be the best instrument.",3
"The sound quality is very good as per the price , and the color & the finishing also.",5
"Very good product for beginners, the quality and the sound is good. I am happy to have this at a very small budget.Thankyou amazon.",4
The guitar colour is pretty okay  but there is stain on the body also the carry case of the guitar is much smaller than the guitar,3
"Quality:3Sound:3(poor)Packaging:4(nice)Looks:3Issues:1.bent neck(no trus rod)  2.poor string quality  3. Does'nt seems DuearbleTip: I would prefer you to buy a quality guitar (which comes for about 6,000)although you a beginner.",3
"Its was a good value for money, only problem was shipping, i believe guitar to be nice but due to uncertain reason it might appear to be scratched or dented.U can get an all fine one if lucky...Just like I did...",4
"I gifted my niece, And heard from her its good and voice is so amazing, its must by guitar for beginners.",4
"Product is good have nice built quality and good sound quality it's great for beginners one should consider this product if someone is searching for their first guitar. The product looks good and packing was also good. No damage and no defects. Received full set with bag, strings, plectrum and strap. Thanks to the seller and Amazon for such a nice product.",5
Gifted my brother and he liked it a lot.Its a nice guitar,4
"Must buy for beginners, doesn't have a cut so can't play 12th fret and beyond that easily. Amazon used to give secondary safety packaging but now it delivers only with Juarez packaging, that may damage the guitar. Hopefully I got it safe, but it was risky not to have a proper packaging.Must Buy in this Price Range.",5
"This product I like because it is very low budget guitar with good quality sound and look l,light weight easy to carry. those who are music lover and cannot afford costly guitar this guitar can satisfy their need of learning music.its full body shape allows the sound more loud and clear.which we can find in costly guitars. Delivered  on time with double packing I am using this guitar since two years working nicely in this price we are getting all accessories so no need to by it separately. And extra set of strins is plus point",5
"Although mrp shows around 7K, they sell it around 2K throughout the year. It is 13inch, check YouTube unboxing videos of this product before purchasing.Strings are of steel, although they say strings are of nylon.Some strings get out of tune frequently",3

"Neck and bridge glued perfectly...often u dont see that with juarez... mediocre finish on the fret...action is way to high at 4mm...for a beginner, this would be rather discouraging...also there is high fretboard buzz + the wood isnt at all good( as soon as i put my arm on it there was a crunch somewhere inside) ...So....unless you are broke af just DONT BUY IT. Returning it and going for kadence acoustic a04 eq at 5k... hopefully that will be better...the best 1 for beginners of course is the yamaha f280 at 7k which is sadly out of stock now😑",2
"This is my second purchase of this brand of guitar. Brought it for my nephew this time... It's great quality for the price light weight and slightly smaller in size than the standard guitars which makes it easy for kids to learn as well as carry. The packaging is very good as well. It comes with a bag, two picks, strap and extra set of strings. Totally impressed by this product. And highly recommend it to all.",5
I play guitar more than 20 years and I bought this to teach my kids while we are traveling. I wasn't expecting much and I was blown away by the quality. It is of course not the quality of a known brand expensive guitar but it is amazing for the money. I can both teach my kids and the guitar is not small enough so I can also play it myself.,5
The default strings are too funky better to replace them,4
"Product received as in picture , look wise good and for beginners it's upto the mark but not suitable for long run",4
This is not for people who want to learn music or playing guitar. The chords don't play well. Only you can play single strings.Don't buy if you want to seriously learn guitar. But you can buy if you want to just have a guitar and just play for fun.,2
Cool,4
"It's the perfect guitar for beginners.,Also I'm a left hand player so I had trouble setting it up., This guitars mechanism is quite simple so I was able to restring it on my own!Performance wise ., It's sound is loud and clear!But it's not a very good quality product., If ur going to jump into guitar now this guitar is fine.. if u want to pursue it seriously or planning to do grades this ain't the product for u..",3
Great guitar at low price I must say. Not only beginners also intermediate can use. It's a semi acoustic version. So works amazing both ways with or without amplifier. Tone is loud and clear. And I loved the color and packaging. Go ahead with it if you are looking for budget guitar.,5
-Sound quality is good.-distance between fretboard and strings is high (Action high)-Medium size sound box.-Good for beginners.-Suitable to buy in 1850/- INR range.,4
This product is good if u have low budget and want to learn guitar but if u have high budget go for branded guitar.,3
Good as expected in this range..😄,4
"At this price,It is the best I can say for beginners.Sound quality, value for money and very good one for beginners",5
"Comparing to the price in which I bought, the guitar is awesome and worth every penny. The only drawback is that it only has 17 frets and the size is really small. If you're doing hours of strumming and jamming your hands will start feeling pain from the elbows and shoulders. Other than that great.",4
I loved it,5
"Item ok. But asper order it is given is country of origin as Made in china  whreas written as made in india. The cover and strap are very poor quality material and stiching found zig zag not in straight , look like local stiching.rest every thing ok.kc madhavan.",2
Ok,3
Not that good for beginners and at best it's quality wise not that good. Get a better one from actual store.Packaging is so good and it also has handles. Strings broke after a time and after that the screws at top are not that good for tuning. It makes sense not to buy this but for very beginning level and if you have greatest teacher then it's good.,2
Guitar is good. But bag is not a quality and its is very tight..,4
"Product is nice, it was not broken eventhough the packaging was broken. Good quality and brand new with paint smell still persists. The logistics team did not deliver it to door step.",4
Nice guitar I like it and the colour is nice good sound and good for beginners superhit 👌👌😉,4
This product is awesome n value for money,5
Cheap guitar! if you find a good guitar any cheaper than this... it’s probably fake or stolen item,4
"Less no of fret, because of short neck",2
Don't buy this you can't play this ... its action is too high....no argument that other things are pretty good but whatever if you can't play this,3
The strings of this guitar are of very poor quality!They keep breaking every now and then.. have already got them repaired 4 times in 3 months .,2
Sound quality are not so good..,3
This is an awesome guitar for beginners under 2k . I really like the product and packaging I received .I buy it for 1990rs. The size is little small than other guitar but it's good handy to use and beautiful looking.,5
,5
I like the look and the sound,4
"It is good for beginners to learn, with sound quality am not satisfied but ok for this cost good one to buy",4
Very best guitar but the bag chain is not good,4
"Well packed but expected better sound, great for beginners it's OK product....",3
It's a perfect guitar for beginners. The products has delivered as the way as i ordered. nothing was damage. It's really good feeling to have it. I like it and completely satisfy.,5
Value for money.,4
This is not a professional guitar but a good one for learning.,4
Looking Good,4
Great quality and build,5
"Master says that ,it is very basic.difficult to tune it...",3
Would not recommend you to buy one if you are new because it is impossible to learn without a teacher on your own. And if you are gonna get a teacher then buy a full sized guitar,5
There's no extra strings and pick only got bag and straps,3
Good product perfect for beginners and best for a low budget Go for it!!!,4
Beginners should try this one. nice acoustic sound.,4
All good reached earlier than given date I am happy with the purchase,4
,5
"The build quality is good, it looks nice. It's good for beginners. Sound quality may be a little average. Nice packaging too.Good Value for money.You can absolutely buy it.",4
The zip in the bag was broken please exchange the bag alone please,4
Sound quality is so good  .but distance between fread bord and string s is so high .And packaging is very poor.,3
I really like the guitar. It was delivered 1 days before. The packing was good and the guitar is so good there r no words to explain if u want a guitar and if u r a beginner this is perfect for u,5
Look is good but the quality of guitar is very bad. When I was setting the strings according to mobile tuner app.... the plastic through which the strings are set is plucked but to strings  nothing happened.,3
I am not at all satisfied. I bought it for my 9 yrs old boy.size is perfect for him .but the quality of sound is very poor. It can't be  tuned properly ..it has manufacturing defect in tuning .I wanted to return .but as it came during corona situation..I thrown out all the boxes before taking it.,2
It's best in this price for beginners..I am impressed with this product.,4
"I like this product very much, i prefer to get grand acoustic guitar strings for better sound, 😊",5
Excellent product,5
"It's fantastic. The sound quality is awesome, easy to hold, best size, the strings quality is little less than mark, overall the guitar is best.",4
It's nice for beginners but kinda small...,4
Apt for beginners. Sound quality is at par with professional and branded guitars. Very satisfied with the purchase.,5
"Product is too good, look as well as sound...Sting quality is not up to the mark., one string is broken while tuning... Package and delivery awesome",4
Didn't receive the bag and extra string pack.,4
Nice one for beginner,4

Size is a big small..Otherwise nice product..,4
Good,4
It was my first time with Amazon I was not so sure but it was the most beautiful guitar its very useful for the beginner I became a regular customer of Amazon since then,5
Good for beginners.,3
"Go to shop and choose from there. Don't buy guitar online. Believe me, if you are serious about learning guitar, then you will regret your decision.",2
Good,4
Thanks Amazon for making available such instrument at a very very reasonable price. Very cute and handy item for beigneers,4
"Got a damaged guitar...had a crack on the back of neck. And colour was also different as expected, though sounds good",4
It's an excellent product for beginners not for experts as they should look for a more costly and efficient one,4
Nic,4
It is really very goodSound is very good,4
Beginners never buy this product,5
Happy!!I wanted it to start learning. The guitar was exactly as shown. Delivery was in a day n in good condition. I paid 1990 and for this price it's too good. I love it !!!,4
Thik thak,3
Good,4
Sound quality not match.....,4
pretty good!,4
its good product to buy for learners who just started learning guitar or have passion towards this,5
Found that the Strings are way too high over the Fret-Board making it difficult to play &  change chords easily.  Sound Quality could have been better. The Get-Up of the Guitar  looks good.  Can something be done about this defect please ?,2
Very nice product for beginners and sound quality is also good I really love this,4
Received it broken and returning it because no extra peice is left .,3
Okay for beginners.  Not a great quality product. But still value for money.,3
I brought this product for 2k very cheap. And it has an amazing and stunning look. I don't know about the sound quality because am a beginner. But when I play it sounds nice. Thanks Amazon.,5
If u want to hold just a guitar in your hands... its okay for that... it is too small in size... its good for the amount of money u send on it..But if u have played other 41 inch guitars before... then u wont like this product much... okay sound and average product.,2
good,4
Nice product in this price segment....sound quality is quite good. Recommended for beginners and advanced as well. 👍,4
The media could not be loaded.,5
Superb Guitar for learners 🙂😎,4
Bought for gift. Feeling embrassed as broken piece received. Requested for replacement,2
"Very very nice product. I would recommend all the beginners to buy it. It is worthful, finished product. Really liked it. Thank you amazon for giving me such a good experience of shopping.",5
"So the guitar is overall good.! The outer quality of the guitar is great but the inner is not as good. A bit tough for a beginner because of a high action.! But if you are beginning your guitar journey with this, then i believe you can play any guitar either of high or low action.You can go for it. If you can ,then go with black or other options as they have cutaway. Natural one has no cutaway so tough to play on the last frets.",5
ok for beginners.,4
Strings settings are not good,5
"There was a problem with guitar that the strings were too far from frets, due to which it was hurting fingers. Otherwise the product is good.",3
Guitar was awesome but sadly it was brokenIt's support wooden stick was damaged that's why gave it 3 otherwise would have rated it 5 as it's the best you can get under 2000 rupees....With some Cashback added... it becomes a steal deal...Have already orderd another guitar from jaurez itself...,3
Very good guitar for beginner..but it very small in size but Quality is so good....,4
Received damaged product. One Extra String is also damaged.,3
This was my first guitar when i wanted to start learning and trust me it's the best of this price range. Everyone must give it a shot if it's there first guitar. Best for beginners.,4
I liked it so much but the sound system was not good after arranging the strings.I am getting this same guitar with all things in better prize,4
Very handy and looks goodFine for bigginers and practice,4
That is very perfect.I promote it.,5
"My brother bought it for my birthday, i was happy and click bunch of photos and posted it on social media,still no success😉.Although i didn't know one thing about how to play guitar but i hope i can get a girlfriend😃.",3
"First time , got a defective one...The action was way too high.After replacement, it was perfect..What more can you get at this price!!!!",5

 For the price I won't complain, but don't expect much. The strings that came with it are bad, change it asap.",3
Perfect for age 12 to 16 beginers,3
Overall a good product in this prize segment. Although could have improved the bass sound of the guitar. Recommend for the beginners.,4
Good,4
Nice product.Perfect for beginners.,3
Good-quality product.,4
Only for begginers.but strings are very tight while playing chords and it hurts my fingers,3
Its good,4
The product quality is up to the mark yet auto tuning is not done properly..You might need to install GuitarTUNA app and manually tune it,4
"This is my second purchase, both of them are awesome, looks great and sounds superb.",5
Satisfied.,3
Good product I'm very happy,5
Best gurtar for begginers but sound quality is not as expected,4
Superb,4
Best gor beginnersBut there was no extra string on the guitar pack.,4
Total value for money for beginners,5
"Even I'm a biggner, it's ok but sound quality is not so good",4
"the product i got is great.I thought it would be too small in size, bt it is ok.I got product for 2,199 rs only according to which it is great.I just did not got a thumb cllip ,that is only a disappointment,but apart from it everything is ok and great",4
It's a pretty decent guitar considering the price....nice sound...but anyone looking for a good lasting guitar could opt for something better...  satisfied since iam a beginner it's the best (learn and change) at this range for me,3
After two return and replacements finally this product arrived safe in my hand. It's a good one. Things happen for good. Overall it's a good deal.,4
This guitar is excellent for beginners....I am impressed with its sound quality......and you go for it...,5
"First up, the guitar does not come with a truss rod, and I won't criticize Juarez on that because I've seen a lot of guitars without truss rods working smoothy for months. In case of this Juarez guitar, after unboxing, the distance between the fret board and the strings was already so much that I could barely play any chord. After a few days, my fingers started to experience slight cuts and it became even more difficult to play by the day.Secondly, an alan key can't be used on the guitar, so now you might wonder why the product is so cheap.So to sum it all up, I would'nt recomend this guitar to any type of group, beginners or experts. So my advice would be to please keep scrolling through the options and find a better product. :-)",1
Nice in this Price range.,3
Good n decentReceived on time,4
Size is small but looks cool. Not fit for adult men as size is small for their height,3
This item is not use for professional,2
Good product but sound quality could have better,5
Good product for a beginner.,4
guiar is great in this prize. But packeging is not good. There is one big whole in this packege. I scared but hopefully there is no damage on guitar. Overall thich guitar is great for begineers.,3
Good for beginners,3
Product is really good,4
When i went to recieve guitar my happiness was at peak level. But after i opened the packing it all crashed because i got a guitar with damage it has crack from strings  i dont get that damaged product it was really good at low cost for beginners . So friends what I suggest every one is to brought a guitar from any good instrument store so that you can satisfy with that product other you may also face same type of problem like me !,1
"Product is very good, But Guiter bridge does not matched as per as design.Please deliver the similer item by given parts.",4

"A good product that has been delivered to me at the specified discount rate. But, they missed the other acccessories specified in the image.I am sad because of that.",5
"Everything's good, just as shown in the picture. Worth the price. Loved it. I would definitely recommend it.",4
Outstanding.. Perfectly finished ..sounds so clear and without even a single problem. Was delivered in a huge packing.. Though it looks like a local make on amazon.in pics. .the quality will leave u speechless..at this price it sounds like better than many brands..its much more than what u pay for..Its a small one..but the sound quality is awesome..also it was very well packed and sparklingly clean and dust free..thanks to Amazon. This was awesomeness,5
Very good product at this price range,4
This is truly impeccable..best for beginners..didnt think of this amazing quality at jst 2500/-..🔥,5
Quality and sound seems good as per guitar price. Preferable for beginners.,4
"For beginners, it's good for learning. Best guitar under 2K. Value for money. Go for it. Delivered a good one. No defect found. Sound quality ok. Looks superb.",5
"Sound of guitar is wonderful. As there is no truss rod, it is impossible to adjust the action. Action increases after some days it becomes hard to press strings.",3

I am happy to buy this.,5

"It is just perfect, light weight and great sound quality.",5
Good for beginners. Sound is below average.,4
The product is not in a very good condition,2
I am truly telling you that don't buy this it is 38inch and the frade has been band in the next few months after perches and you can't repair that because there is no rod inside .i recommend you to spend 2500-3000 and go to your nearest shop and you will have great deal. :(,2
"1 month into buying this guitar, a string got broke. And a month later, the whole bridge came off the top board with the screws while i was trying to tune the guitar. The strings keep going out of tune frequently, i don't know if the fault is with the tuning pegs or the loose bridge. Overall a very bad experience.",1
If the fretboard would have truss rod then it would be like cherry on the top for this masterpiece.,5
Product is up to the mark....great one for beginners and value for money,4
"So good! At this price point. If you want to learn guitar or if you are newbie, this one would be the best choice.",5
String broken the second day i bought and also the extra string also broken.poor quality and also more space between the board and string hard to play .Overall less better.,3
"very good product,no damage and good packing....",5

Good,3
Sound is not good. Not easy to hold,3
For a beginner this guitar is good. All good except that the second string has to be pressed down extra hard. Rather than encouraging new players it will discourage them as the finger tips hurt a lot on 2nd string.,3
Amazing product,4
An excellent cheap option for beginners. Value for money. Reached in good condition even though the packing was poor.,5
Guitar is fine... Packing is ok... But the stricker is missing,4

Very good product,4
"It is perfect for teenagers, not for adults, looks good, sounds good but it is not durable...at this price ok...",4
I have some experience of playing guitar. After lot many efforts which I had put in to tune this guitar I come to this conclusion that this is not a guitar which you can play this is only a show piece which can be used to decorate home or shop. Lost all E strings but could not tune it. That was so painful. I didn't like this guitar and want to return it back. Don't buy this cheap guitar you will end up nothing but like a losser. I want to return this crap.,1
Good for my son as he started learning.,4
Good product,4

The product is awesome for biggners.  The Strings are and sound quality is good.,4
i use this from 1 year and learned so many things til date. easily tuned. easy to play all cods supperbb,5
I like this product and it's meeting my expectations.,5
It's design quality is good,4
Awesome for begineers with good built quality.Tones are nice at high tune.Handy and easy to carry,5
At this price I never expected this much good quality guitar and that too in a rare wood color.,4
Strings are situated very high position from finger board.It should be more nearer to finger board.,3
The sound quality not so good .,3
"The strings are weak, and the bridge made up of platic is low quality.Tough to tight the strings and got broken wile adjustment",2
I love it. Good for beginners and should go for it.,4
"The guitar is cheap but comes with a price. The tuning does not stay in place and upon tightening the strings, the nut seems like cracked and lifted off. The G, B, and E strings are too high from the fret board and hurts your fingers while trying to play the notes. Another downside from Amazon is that we can only get a replacement but no money back. I do not recommend this product.",1
Being a beginner was confused whether to go for Yamaha f310 to get the best in range of 10k .....but until you firm on your passion one can do practice on this guitar.Awesome sound and very handy though its not full size of 22 fret....perhaps 18 fret neck not disappointing at all. Go for this if you are beginner.....sure won't regret.,5
good for a beginner...my son was happy unboxing the package...sound is sharp and pretty loud...build quality is better than expected...no complaint about the packing..,2
"Very nice product. Great for beginners as well as experts. The only problem was that the guitar cover's zip was broken. But still, a big thumbs up from me!!",5
Very less space between stings for normal fingers. May be good for only thin fingers.,3
"Tuning key is not free, but perfact for this price",3
"Excellent value for money, complete package, with extra set of strings",5
"Worst experience, only good thing was product delivered on time rest everything is wrong, it was broken, strings were not on the place. Even the delivered problem is different as it has a weird circle pattern which is not in the original pictures they have shown.",1

Very nice amd affordable guitarIt is really good for the beginners,4
Best guitar for beginners I recommend this product.  ...,5
It's a good acoustic guitar for beginners strings are good decent strap and set of strings but quality of bag is poor over all guitar is good,5
"You may think this will be a pretty decent guitar for you but if you wanna actually play the guitar, then get a better one. This one has low frets as mentioned, the quality of wood and the strings was awful, same goes for the way it's made. Having such low number of frets make it harder to play some songs. However this depends on you, but even if you are a beginner, get a better guitar in the price range of 5000-10000 INR. I returned this guitar because I had expected something better than this. It is really a toy.",1
Too small.,3
Nice guitar,4
Good one for beginners. Good product in given price.,5
Damage product deliver.bad quality,1
"The looks and all is everything okay, but the fretboard and the string got a lot gap btw 'emIt make is harder to play or learn anything on it.The gap is larger than there should be",2

"Don't go for it cause after some time you will realise that you have made a mistake it is just a below average guitar below average sound quality so, add some more money in your budget.",2
Low quality wood n half made of plastic,1
Good product,3
It has arrived in the broken condition.,1
Great value for money. Getting what you paid for. Perfect for beginners,4
Suprbb quality for beginners....free mind u can buy this giutar..and saving money and helping beginners to learn giutar...sound quality also good and strings are so perfect and smoot to changing cords,5
"Ummm....  It's considerably small than general guitar, but again it's cheap than them also.  Being cheap, it certainly used cheap material to build the item. Guitar comes untuned,  so don't worry and tune it up first. Sound quality is up to mark,  no problem there once tuned up.  If you are a beginner, just like me,  than i strongly recommend that you use Yousician app for learning from the very basics.Lost 1 star for its material qualityAnother star for its size",3
"Good guitar ,arrived very soon ,fair for the price but it tuNe little weird sometimes😐🙄",3
"Very bad quality! The neck of my guitar bent within a month! It's not playable anymore. Wrote email to Juarez music, they didn't respond. It a waste of money!",1

Very nice Good quality sound is epicOther things are also nice  it is very nice string are very nice👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍😀,5
It is very good.It is good for beginners.It's sound quality is not so bad.You can by it if you want.,5
Its many have crack,2
Worth its price. It's good for beginners,4
The guitar tune is set to EAADGB instead of EADGBE and it's not even the tuning problem the strings needs to be changed in order to make it right which will take a professional to do it. Not worth paying for it and still go thru the pain of doing this.,1
"Have seen some reviews saying guitar is good, etc., so am putting this review. This guitar is NOT good and anyone who says anything else either doesn't know to play guitar or is writing on behalf of Juarez1. String s are high above the fretboard, making playing hard2. Fretboard is plastic, not ebony as mentioned in listing.3. Fretboard is exactly flat. This is not ideal for playing chords at all. Only lead playing is possible with this guitar, but with lot of effort. If anyone disagrees, put up a video in colour showing the guitar model and playing the barred F chord at fret 1.4. No truss rod. So no chance of any adjustments. I was told to use this guitar as a showpiece by a renowned music shop5. Bridge is plastic also.6. Tuning pegs are wobbly. Remove a string and try to move the tuning peg - if it moves, it's not good and will not hold strings in tune.7. Guitar is extremely light. This means that only ply wood is used throughout and the quality of the instrument is poor.Buying this guitar for a beginner will guarantee that he will quit playing guitar very soon. As suggested, go to a reputablemusic store and ask for a good guitar. The worst guitar there will be better than this Juarez",1

"Pros- Low cost- Reasonable toneCons- Cheap, flimsy construction, Fret board scratched within one week of playing.- Poor quality strings, dropped a note every time the guitar was stored after playing. After re-tightening, the higher E broke.I guess you will have these drawbacks with such a low cost guitar.",1

Very good product 👍👍👍,5
The quality was just great. Loved the product except for the fact.. the 1st (thinnest wire) broke only on 3rd day of usage. But thanks to extra wires provided it was fixed😊.,4
Good,5
All in all an okayish guitar meant for beginners. But a great one to start my music journey. The string quality provided is not so nice though.,4
"Good for a beginner I am enjoying it, it arrived in a very good condition with great sound quality. It is an 18 fret guitar, so you may not be able to play all the songs you want. Suppler clearly made note of this in their description of the product.",5
