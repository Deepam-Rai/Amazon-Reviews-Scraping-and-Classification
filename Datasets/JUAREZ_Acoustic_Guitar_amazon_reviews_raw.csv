 It's fine.. but the action is too high making it hard to play tabs.. and almost impossible to play bar cords.. it's ok for basic open cords.. and sound good enough",3
It is good looking and sound is decent but its only best for few months then its string goes up from the fretboard.If u buy it you have to go on a better guitar after some time.,3

Sounds good & value for money product gor beginners.,4
"I think this is the best budget guitar for beginners, love its finishing & build quality",5
"After using it for almost a year I can suggest it to beginners bcz it is beginner friendly❤️.....& If you want to take a budget guitar for beginners then you will go on it.👍and last thing about this guitar is that, it is very handy[u will perfectly do barre chords & others]....and thats all.😅",5
"I received a piece with micro damages but the reason why I'm giving 5stars is it has the option to replace the item, and only in rare circumstances you will get a damaged products and about th guitar it's the best for this price range and its a best one for the beginners",5
Action is a bit too high….so considerable force is required to ring out the chords….otherwise the condition was perfect,5
Reasonable price for a guitar,4

It's strings are not good,3
If you can play something in guitar and if you want good quality sound then go for higher model of this series else it is good for small kids only.,4
Good in this price but could be more better,3
Value for money product 🎸🎸,5

 You have to tune guitar within 1 or 2 days for better sound quality",5
Nice 👍,4
Good product,5
"I bought this guitar during lockdown oct 2019. It's kind of late as I'm writing this review (i have exams tommorow i don't know what Iam doing xD)So basically this guitar is a beginner guitar but in my opinion a beginner should not have any kind of Barrier blocking them to become a good guitarist and i think this guitar kind of makes the journey less fun, why? Because the sound quality is really very poor it also only has 18 frets, acoustic guitars have 20. It shouldn't really make a difference since you wouldn't be playing that high when first starting out until you reach 1-2 years.TLDR: try to push your budget a bit more and consider buying a dreadnought guitar. Iam altho very grateful for having this as my first Guitar, it taught me how to maintain my guitar.",3
✌✅,5
Not received pick or extra strings,4
I ordered this guitar because of its attractive price and no doubt that at this price range this guitar is amazing i would recommend this guitar to beginners who are planning to buy a guitar .🍁,5
"Guitar came fully packed with bubble wrap. No damage occured to guitar. All items were delivered (guitar, bag, 2 peck and pack of strings.). Stunning look. I don't know about the quality of sound as I am a begineer and so no idea about that. Otherwise top notch!",5
Nice guitar for beginners to learn.,4
Good quality perfect for beginners and professionals,5
Actually it is good for beginner in rs 2000 you can just go for the cheaper one and then you know how to play guitar you get expectives in how to play guitar so then you can go for expensive one like so mean,3
"Picks miss, call to customers care they suggested to purchase new picks, we will be Rieumbers the bill.",3

I didn’t get the pick to play the guitar,4
"Sound quality is very good , it may be some less than costly guitars. Good looking guitar on chief rate",4
"In 2022 we doing such cost cutting and giving a bad product 😊😊See...the manufacturers still have to work alot on quality ,alot,,don't do such things, kindly fucus on consumer satisfaction.And stop this ""Customer to kya pata chala raha hai ,aese hi bhejdo jaisa bana hai,dekhi jayegi"",Guys!!!! This is so igonorant",2
It's very nice in my personal review i loved it u can trust and order it if u want to talk about the collity 10/10 everything 10/10.,5
The first guitar which I received had crack on its neck. As soon as I started tuning it the crack got widened up. So I asked for an exchange. Within 2 days I got exchange product which has a dent and small crack on the bottom part. I asked for exchange but they refused saying an order can be replaced only once. They are ok to give me a full refund by returning guitar. But I'm not sure I'll get an guitar with an offer price of 1700 in future. So I'm ok with it since damage is minimal and does not affect the tuning.Sound quality is goodStrings are not good. Better to change it with good grade strings.Product packaging and making is not all upto the mark. Guitar has cracks or damage in any one of the place.Overall a good guitar for a beginner untill he learns to play in a short period of time,3
It's very beautiful,5
"Awesome Guitar in cheapest price best for beginners.. Yes the fret tension is high.. But i will tell u the hacks, just remove the bridge saddle (White Parts) [if u don’t know what is saddle]Cheers and thank me later..",3
"Sound quality is decent, but for the price it is ok.",5
Easy to hold and nice color and avg sound.. Best under 2000,5
Nice,4
😍I love it ❣...very nice 👌..,4
"Fast delivery, package safely delivered, guitar was intact and in good condition. Sound of the guitar was good.",4
I like that design and colour sound quality is also good but string to frets ratio is little far from each other,4
Good price,5
Best for beginners,5
Very good,5

 No bag not working",4
"The first one that arrived - the neck was completely broken in to two. So before you receive the package, check package integrity. Mine was looking ok, but still I can see a dent marks in the neck area where the guitar was broken.Amazon picked my broken guitar and immediately replaced it with the new one in no time.When they picked the old one, I was looking for the Neck Band, Extra Strings and Strummer. They were not found. But then only when I got the new guitar I realised they were inside the guitar bag's side pocket. The moment I opened the cardboard box, I knew the neck was broken before I can take the guitar out of the box - just via the transparent polythene package.So thanks to Amazon for replacing it quickly, but at the same time, caution to those who are ordering this guitar to just pay attention to the package detail and inform the delivery person in advance. I don't think we can do nothing else but just give an attempt for replacing the guitar.",4
"I initially bought it just for hobby and endup training on it and realised that you can just use it as a show piece or jst gift to someone but this is definitely not the guitar you want to learn on. A simple analogy: You wanna learn coding go get a laptop to code not a smartphone to code, even though you can.",2
"Product is good, means I m lucky as got product without any scratch. As I read comments, I thought may be I will got broken one😀. Guitar is good for beginners, the accessories they r given like bag and pic is beggars quality. But u can buy it from store. For me it is good bet.",4
Product is good but some parts are missing,2
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 You can see in the video the defect and the scratch good for beginners and sound quality was good",3
Nice & genuine product. Good product for beginners. Good sounds. Product packaging also too sturdy & appropriate. Thanks to Amazon,5
Need little quality for the body... But its ok for some occasion,3
Good product received without damage,4
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 After some time the neck is going to bend and there is no truss rod to adjust. Due to this distance between strings and frets will increase. Would've given 5star if the product is included truss rod.",4
The most important to know that this guitar just for classical look . The sound quality was bad . I say that for Beginners this is not perfect to us. We have to choose the better guitar for better sound . When i buy this its look pretty . But the way i playing the guitar its giving a different sound I was just confused .,2
"Cost wise it is good, but the thing which is irritating is that I need to tune it everytime regularly.I feel strings and tuning pegs should improve.",3
It is a very nice guitar for a biginer like me.. Easy to hold.. Easy to tune .. Easy to carry,5
No straps and strings,2
"First things first...do not expect a Fender or Yamaha quality guitar to pop out of that package, since you are not paying that much. The guitar is really good for beginners and the price is too awesome. I have played other high-end guitars like Fender, Pluto and Gibson, but this guitar is a real delight to play.Surprising thing is that the guitar in pic has a white seam border, which looks a bit odd, but the guitar I received was seamless black and awesome looking. I got three pics instead of two as shown, and other accessories as shown like the strap and extra string set. Be careful while attaching the strap to the guitar as it has only one fastening end at the bottom. You can attach the other end at the neck of the guitar using the black string they have provided. You can the video tutorial on YouTube on How to attach the strap if only one fastening end is given.The only disappointment is regarding the product finish. The paint is off in few places and the finish only tells you that it is not a high-end guitar. Amazon went way overboard with the packaging of the guitar, which I felt was very unnecessary. There was more than 100 bubble sheets for the protection.Pros:1. Amazing Looking Guitar2. Great Sound3. Light Weight.4. Strings and Wood Quality is very good.Cons.1. One size smaller than standard acoustic guitar (I am not sure).2. Finish is not that overwhelming.3. Guitar Action (distance between Fret board and Strings) is quite high.Overall, just go for it, its worth your money.",5
Color 😍,5
Bad products,3
It's too good,5
Guitar is good.... Also it was my mistake to not check the bag pockets before writing.. I received all the accessories... Everything till now is in good condition... I apologise for writing a negative review without checking properly...,5
If you are a beginner and don't want to invest in a costly guitar just go for this one. You will not be disappointed I swear ❣️,4
"The quality of guitar is fantastic and looking attractive  , but packaging is not that much good and it is tough to learn Chord",3
Good Product,4
After using it for more  then 8 months its a great guitar for the price lot of people saying its only useful in the first 6months of learning but you can use it as long as you want cuz i learned open chords and bar chords finger picking on it its great for fingerstyle and finger picking the high action makes it little difficult for finger pressing but you will used to it the sound is great for the price you can use it for years,4
Packaging was good but it was having crack from all sides of neck. Which is the main part of guitar to watch for.,3
"This is my very first experience with a guitar. After using it for half a year, here's how I feel -Sound quality: I honestly didn't expect the guitar to sound this good. And it didn't, at first. But once I tuned it properly... Voila! It's rich, it's full, and one cannot possibly ask for more at this price! (Rating: 4.5/5)Build quality: The guitar's lightweight and doesn't feel very sturdy, however, apart from a few dents incurred due to accidental collisions with other objects, it's still in one piece. Being a budget offering, it doesn't have a truss rod, which makes the neck prone to bending, but I haven't had that happen to me yet. The strings are of low quality though and had begun to rust within the first fortnight itself. (Rating: 3.5/5)Comfort: This is one area where this guitar is absolute crap. Especially for a beginner. The action - or the distance between the strings and the fretboard - is a bit too much, making it that much harder for a newbie to master the art of playing a guitar. Even if you're determined enough to persist with it, there's no way you'll be able to play it for extended periods of time - without inflicting serious damage upon your fingers, that is. (Rating: 1.5/5)Final verdict: This is not meant for people who are serious about learning how to play a guitar. It's for those wanting to take a 'test drive' before committing fully to that idea. Or, if you're like me and just need a stress-buster (of the musical kind) to help you unwind after a long day at work - this guitar should suffice. It's nothing more, nothing less. (Overall rating: 3/5)",3
"Not worth it…..You won’t be able to use it for any purpose….It’s just a waste of money….After learning for two weeks, my tutor straightaway told me to buy a new guitar coz its sound is not upto the mark….Won’t recommend to anyone….Don’t buy it",1
I have received the Guitar but there were no Strings or picks with it.,5
Guitar was buy from bigners .Great soundAnd good qualityBut Amazon didn't give splectrum and string 😡😡😡😡,4
Good under this price range (1700),4
At a price of 1.9 k it's good for wannabes.The sound quality is average.The build is good for the price it is offered.The action (distance between strings and fret board is very high). Have to press really hard to get proper soundThe Allen keys option is not there. But at this price it's a waste to think about it.String quality is ok.In my view it's good for kids who are just beginning to learn guitar.,3
I like it,5
Good sound. quality product.,5
Best Guitar with excellent sound,5
"Small size,",4
"Actually its hard to learn from this guitar... The Distance between fretboard and String way too much and it's make difficult to play chords... and if you think to buy finger protection it will not help, cause Finger protection will take more space on string so you end up pressing the Wrong string",4
"I got excited about guitars after I saw a few guitar videos and tutorials. I was not sure if I can maintain my interest in learning and playing guitar. Hence without much investment, I was looking for an average quality guitar.This guitar does the job, although the quality is definitely at par with Yahama or Faith guitars. If you are a pre-beginner and wants to learn the basic strumming, fingering and chords, this guitar will do the job. Once you reach a beginner or intermediate level, you can go ahead with better quality guitars.You also get extra set of strings, 2 picks and an average quality bag.I broke A string on the very first day while trying to tune the guitar, hence extra set of string comes handy. Be careful with tuning.If someone is a pro and has used quality guitars, they might find this guitar below average. But for pre-beginners like me, it just does the job.I got this for 2200 but I have seen a few people buying it for 1900 to 2100 as well. If you are getting it under 2500, its a fair deal I guess. Also you can have a look at Intern guitars as well which are also for pre-beginners.Overall happy with the product.",5
Good quality.,5
"यदि आप गिटार सीखने की शुरुआत कर रहे हैं तो, यह आपके लिए सबसे अच्छा गिटार साबित हो सकता है। मैं गिटार सीखने की शुरुआत में ज्यादा खर्च नही करना चाहता था। इसीलिए मैंने इस गिटार का चयन किया। इसकी साउण्ड क्वालिटी बढ़िया है। मैं पिछले 2 वर्ष से इस गिटार का इस्तेमाल कर रहा हूँ, मूझे अबतक किसी भी तरह की समस्या नही हुई।",3
No doubt for beginners it is bestGood Sound QualityThe size is little bit smaller than the regular one.i would have given in 5 out of 5 but i didn't cause at first the delivery period was so long i took about 10 days and i too got one scratch at the edge of the guiter and little broken at backside of it....the packaging was not so good.Only covered with a thin tharmocoal layer and plastic...it must be covered with the thik tharmocoal and bubble wrapper too.Anyways for beginners i would suggest this....And yes it's only about 2000 what could you more expect??!! Just Go For It...i hope you get safe product.Thank YouKeep Music Alive,4

 It was simply awesome with quality and he loved it when I gifted him. Highly recommended for beginners 👍🏻😊",5
Easy to learn,5
The product received is little much damaged,3
"Using it for almost 1.5 months, got it without damage.Turning is the biggest problem, for short period strings getting loose.Gap between fret and strings are more, very difficult for beginners.Having a guitar for fun and getting started its ok.But for guitar learners go for a different guitar with price range of 5000.",4

 So cool amezing product..🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍",5
After 1 months it sounds little fade. But far better than a second hand guitar in this price for learning .Bag is not good it was start cracking in few days of use . Only for beginners,4
Guitar look is good but some Frets point is not good. I don’t like Fretboard finishing. A string sounds quality is not ok because Frets point in not ok. Picguard also not install.,3
Ok,2
After 3 months of usage but it's okI used to tune twise a week,4
"I am a beginner level player, and this was my first guitar. So here's what I feel about it.It is a good looking, decent quality guitar with decent strings and good sound. I have tried guitars at shops, but they were all high priced and I was looking for something which is low ranged because I didn't know whether guitar is actually my cup of tea.The size is decent for most girls and teenage boys (I am a teenage girl). If it was any bigger, it would have been pretty huge for me to handle.The whole package at this price is a treat. You get extra strings, 2 plectrums, strap and a bag. All items are of decent quality according to the price.The strings are made of steel. Many people had this doubt as it's written nylon in the description.It is a single body guitar, and it sounds good and looks fine. You won't find it cheap looking in any way. It's made of wood, which isn't of the best quality, but a fine one.The action of the guitar is decent. It's not the best that I have played, but it's fine for the cost.It's not difficult to tune, though I struggled for the first tuning when I got it. It stays in tune for pretty long, I only have to tune mine about once every day, to make sure and adjust the slight difference (of about -2 or -3 in some chords). So that is really good.Final verdict- I don't know about the advanced players, but if you are a newbie then this can be your first guitar. It's cheap, and provides a full package at this price. Also, you can upgrade the guitar when you reach a higher level without feeling guilty.",4
"Worth buying under 2k at least for beginners, or for those who can't afford guitar at a high price.",5
"It's such a cheap quality product the wood, the Colour & everything. Size is also smaller.",3
"If you are a beginner, this is an amazing guitar. Wondering why?? It takes time for you to know your guitar. You start learning -  how hard you have to press the strings, there are many scenarios where you just break the string unknowingly now, if you have have purchased a good one, it will cost you too much to change the strings etc.",4
Good 👍,5
"Overall product is good for beginners who don't know about guitar and playing for first time & still learning.  I am writing this review after use this about 2 to 3 months.  • I received a good condition guitar.  • This guitar has no truss rod.  • Action(distance between string and fretboard) is high, your finger feel little more stress during playing.  • String quality is average.  • Guitar body attracts scratches more easily.  • Light weight guitar.  • Sound is good and not so loud because Guitar body is small and having 18 frets.  Can be a good choice for beginners.",3

 Bag quality poor hai But Itne mei or kya expect kr sktey hai Baki Sab Awesome hai If u r a freshy then u should buy!",3
I ordered a black acoustic guitar but they send me a different colour. It's fine but still I specially ordered black because of it's colour.. Hence I was disappointed by this. I was waiting for few years to buy this & when I got it's not up to my wish.,3
Dmmaged in fred area,4
The spring action is high that make people difficult to press the strings and for a beginner this isn't a good start . Beginners shall invest a better one you shall go atleast for guitars minimum of rs. 5000 or more. Coming to the sound of it not  the best!!,4
It's best... Superb .. but it's g string is not perfect it acts as d string .. it's ok for everyone.. u can change g string ... Other than it it is best ..,4
this is my first guitar and i really like it ❤️❤️❤️,5
Okay so I've given this guitar a 4 on 5 as when I received it the first time it's packaging was so bad and the guitar was broken from the neck! After 6 days of patience when  you'll get such a defected product  you can sense how it feels!!!But then I ordered for the replacement for the same and got it delivered at my place after another 5 days of desperate waiting and then I got the actual product  and it now it's on its wires!! A fabulous buy for beginners and good sound quality!!!,4
Pretty Decent for Kickstarter but the action height needs to be decreased as it will be hard for beginners and don't worry the wood quality is great at this point of price if you are beginner go for it,4
Good product.,4
Waste of time and money. I got broken product not in any use. Don't order this. We are trying to return it from last 15 days,1
Must buy this product,4

 In this price the guitar is awesome and sound quality is good but guitar bag quality is not good",5
"I have recieved this product and after analyzing the points are :-1. PACKING:- the packing was so good that there wasn't a scratch or dent on the outer part.2. CLOSING:- The guitar was enclosed in polythene, then a thick translucent white polythene cover, then by a cardboard box, first by the seller Juarez and over it amazon branding polythene.3. INSIDES:- there was a guitar, A cover, Two Pick 0.71mm, Guitar Shoulder Strap and 6 Strings.4. GUITAR:- The guitar was glossy, no scratch, no dent, no damage. CHECKED from all angles and with flash and light. The guitar received with fully precised packing and handling.5. PRODUCT REVIEW:- The strings were not tuned which is a good thing, you can tune as per your convenience. After tuning it sounds good, the eco and vibrations are quite lovely.Feedback:- If you are a beginer and wants your hands on a good guitar in best budget, this is what you are looking for. Buy it I will say.",5
Strings wer nt of standards...Need better strings.. guitar for this price is good though...,3
It's a little small as compared to what you would expect regular acoustic guitars to be. But that's what makes it worthwhile and easy to learn.,4
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Nice product quality and all is well and colour is same as shown.",5
Perfect for kids who are very much interested about the guitar and want to learn it as it is compact but for beginners I'd say not worth the shot. For beginners I'd suggest to spend around 5k or so and order it from Bajaao.com as they deliver the product with utmost care and the products are flawless. Best for people who wants to buy a guitar but unable to visit a store.,4
Ossum and nice,4
"It is a good product for learning. I want you to know something. If you are learning then only buy this if you already know how to play, then don't buy.",4
"Product is Avarage , Recevied only one pic, instead of two",3
"It looks good and is suitable for beginners. But the bag is of inferior quality. It didn't fit, was smaller and the zipper came off immediately. Since there is no option to only exchange the bag, I didn't bother. But my daughter is happy with the guitar. The sound is good and proper.",3
"I am new to musical instruments. I wanted to start with a pretty cool instrument and so I chose guitar. As I didn't know a lot about guitars I chose to experiment with a guitar starting with a comparatively low price. And when taking that into consideration, I think this guitar would be a good choice to go with.",5
It's small guitar and sounds are not too good. Buy only if you want this for a child of less than 12years. Else invest in good guitar of yahma which Is more durable and sounds proffesional. It's not that good. But sitghting its price it's good only for children's who just want to have one but not for serious music lovers.,3
The best one in the price. Wood quality is not that good but should not be complained for that price.,4
"As soon as u open the box first thing that hits you is the smell of the paint used on the guitar. And you take it into your hands you cant help but think how cheap it looks even considering the price point.If you are a beginner, you definitely want a guitar that is well built... u can compromise on the looks for a low priced guitar but it should be sturdy one. The neck of this guitar ( at least the one that amazon or whoever the actual seller is tried selling me ) is soooo weak that you will break it in couple of weeks... especially if you are a beginner you are more likely to break it due to incorrect pressure and left hand positioning on the guitar neck.The one I received...had no protective packagingPaint work was shabby and uneven...u can feel it and see it cheap2nd string was bent or crooked (exactly over the hole area)The neck was not goodI cannot comment on how it sounds..coz i looked at it and did not want to play it all....may be the lowest priced ... but wots the point of spending even that 2k if it doesnot entice you into playing it???The many good reviews of the product made me buy this with confidence but all my confidence was shaken and was utterly disappointed with the seller and the item that was tried to be sold to me.Simply giving 3 stars on assumption that I was unlucky to have received a fraudulent piece and others might have received genuine or good product.",3
"Still banging it, super super effective for beginners. If your just starting out then go for this only, after playing regularly for a year then you can go for the orihinal size and good quality Yamaha guitars and so, been 3 years since I bought this, after 2 years I haven't been playing regularly but still gives satisfaction when playing in my free time. Also learn good tutorials from #GuitarZeroToHero - in youtube",4
Not as well ad expected,3
"Starting from start...packaging was well so there was no doubt of getting the product damaged...i loved that they provided a starp an extra set of string a bag because obviously it is a beginner guitar then beginners need it how will they have these thing previously and if u go to buy a bag u cant range below than 400 so, its a good deal...then come to the guitar ...I'm using it and I showed it to of my friends who play guitar and have a good knowledge of it...as what they said it is a very good guitar in this price range good enough sound just need to get good strings and everything is fine if u r low budgeted as me...",5
"Nice Guitar 🎸 For Beginners, Children,poor people .You can became a good musician by this Guitar 🎸Guitar definitely good this price range & sounds quality is really really very good.Thanks 😇😊",4
"This is one of the cheapest guitars out there and it was my first so I didn't know how bad it was until I tried my cousin's 15k acoustic Yamaha guitar. So I guess if you just wanna try learning the guitar or something it's a good choice. And also you know the saying, ""blame the engineer not the tools"". lel",3
My money got wasted all over scrates and broken we cannot play it now. Bad experience,1

Sound  quality is worse we have to tune but won't get a good one even after turning... strings are also of less quality...If you want to learn you can choose this but only suitable for learning.....For the rate I think it's worth... Finishing and shape are good... delivery was also perfect and packaging was superb....,3
I love the product 😍❤️,5

I was searching for a good guitar and I found this one. The reviews were good. But the wasn't too good. It's just average. This is my detailed review.ProsIt is very cheap.Good colour and attractive bodyConsI have seen many reviews saying that it is good for beginners. But it is not. It's action is very high and it will be difficult to play this . For those who don't know what action is it is the distance between strings and fret. It is very high which makes it difficult to play.Also it is getting out of tune very frequently.If you can buy a better one please do.If this your only choice then it's up to you,3
"The quality of guitar is up to the mark, suitable for beginners. And quite affordable.",4
"Product is great, Good packing, nothing was damaged as shown in few reviews. I'm a beginner and am doin good so far. Just needs frequent adjusting. Don't buy extra tuner .Apps in phone is sufficient.",4
"Best product in this price range, good for beginners  . Sounds pretty good. If you want to learn guitar and don't have much money so this is the best option for you. But don't forget to take care after buying it.",4
Very good for a beginner.Guitar is superb.Tune it with somebody whose professional or use Guitar Tuna app. Or Yousician.I only have a problem with the guitar cover the straps are weak and the cover is of cheap quality. Weak stitches.Could charge a bit extra and provide quality cover and a stand and tuner .That would make it a perfect deal.But then in 2000 it's fine. Can get the cover stitched.Overall happy with the purchase.,4
1 thin string got broken and we have replaced with the sparce provided along this purchase. And now working fine.,4
"The guitar is very good, finishing is great and polishing also. I liked the guitar. And the packing was awesome means the guitar was packed in a very careful manner.",4
"Good quality guitar... However the string quality isn't very durable .. the first string broke on tuning and when replaced by the extra set of strings ...It broke again... Had to buy from a music store... However... My guitar ""sir"" did say that the quality of the guitar was good except that there is a certain level of buzzing that the strings produced in initially... It did fade away with time.... and especially since it came with guitar case and picks etc... It is value for money. Only my first string has broken... The others are still intact... So hence giving 4 stars for this product... I would recommend it to beginners to buy it. Have been using it for more than a month now",4

"1)Packaging delivery was all good,It's good for money.But not recommended.I read the same reviews but was on a tight budget and hurry.Hence made a mistake.2)Even for a beginner don't buy.Only preferred for children for FUN PURPOSES ONLY.3)Every 2 weeks you need to tighten the strings to get the std sound.And the more you tighten it more the handle will bend to front side as the wood will not be able to withstand the pressure.Which is not at all good.P.S.-If you really wanna learn join classes who provide their guitar for practice and then with some more bucks have something authentic afterwards.",4
Best guitar for new learner. Look n sound quality is good,5
"This guitar is great for beginners. I started playing with this guitar and it hasn't disappointed me at all. And it's been 5 years since I bought it( I didn't play it too for 2 years), still shines like a new one. Very sturdy.",5
"When you are not sure about Guitar as your passion/hobby or you just wanna try out, for 2000 (around) , it's the best guitar in the market to begin learning.Sound Quality is good, it looks good things I don't like it only have 1 dot for 12th fret, strings pack which comes with it are not labelled for beginners it almost impossible to judge which is which, they could have given a thinner pick for strumming. Also, build quality is not good, however for 2k it's justifiable.If they can fix it, its 5/5 from me. Until then 4/5.Edit 1:Tried my old guitar and released strings are really far from fret board in this guitar, it's really tough to play bar chords as compared to my rocks guitar where I am easily able to. But yes I have learned due to this Guitar as we need to apply a lot pressure in this one for bar or chords.",4
Good product,4
This product is inconsistency in action. If two people buy this same guitar they can get different action that too with huge difference. The first time i got this action was 5mm for 1st string and that is too high to begin with. I went for replacement and the product i got for replacement had 6mm action. So I would suggest not to waste yout money on these kinds of guitar. Even if you are a beginner and if you can spend 2-3K extra then plz buy a good guitar in 5K segment. This I would not suggest to anyone. As the action is high you will face a lot of difficulty in pressing the strings.,2
Good,5
Value for Money,4
Good for all,5
"Writing a review after extensive usage for over two years. This guitar is absolutely one of the best buys ever. Rs. 2000 is an absolute steal. I have a Fender FC and a Yamaha F310 and bought this one since I relocated to another city for two years, and wanted a spare guitar I can junk.Guitar is in perfect shape and I won't be junking it ! Stays tuned for atleast 2-3 days with lots of playing (8-10 hours). Stays tuned afterward too but may need to fine tune. Tone quality is decent. Again, an absolute steal for 2000 rupees.Among companies like Juarez, most of their guitars are good but there can be a chance that you may get 1/10 pieces that are defective. Else it you get a well made piece, this is a great buy",5
Price ke hisab se thik h,4
U need better quality change the stock strings,5
just go for the product you'll definitely love it if u are a beginner,4
"I would like to say that its exceedingly amazing product. The quality is superb at this price range. Go for it, youll never regret.",5
It's good for beginners.... You know .... Like for test drives.... But professionaly... There are better alternatives,4
"Beginners go for it, Great product👍 👌. So I got my replacement very soon 😀 Thank you Amazon🤗🤗.Customer always make a video or click photos before unboxing (convenient for us and seller too). Yes I got a damaged product before (previous damaged photo also uploaded). But they delivered me a new guitar very early👍 what i expected. 😊",4
I have been using this guitar for 2 monthsPros1. Packaging was good2. Sound quality is ok3. Spare string includedCon's1. Build quality not that great : pegs vibrate while playing.2. Action is high. which hurts my finger for pressing down too hard.Over all good for beginners and worth the money (bought for 2K),4
good in this price range sound is not that mind blowing but best for beginners,4
"Everything is average abiut this guitar, if you are buying it for fun that its okay hut if you are learning a guitar thenI would not recommend this.",2
nice product,5
If you are the begginer this is an ok guitar but you will have to discard or after 2-3 months of usage of you want to learn to play chords,3
Strings are very bad ...high e strings got damaged one first day only while tunning..guitar is nice and easy to handle,4
"Not very beautiful.  Sound is a bit country &western style, not a full sound, just fair. Easy to play. For the discount price it is a fair product, but the full.price is not worth it.",3
Please don't buy this guitar . After watching all reviews you will definitely think to buy it but Please don't go for it . Sound is ok But the most important it doesn't have truss rod . Means this guitar doesn't have it . So eventually this  guitar's neck will start to bend and you can't do anything . It will unplayable . I do big mistake to buy . Don't go on look . It's look is perfect but future of guitar is not good,1
Good for a beginner as in build quality is also decent.,4
Strings are not working properly,3
It's very good one and the sound quality also good...but the product is a little bit damaged and one of the string of broken...so I am not satisfied with that broken string...,3
Very nice product given as shown as in picture very good guitar for beginners love it ❤️,4
At this price range it was awesome 😎,4
I like this product verymuch as it has more quality than i expected..such an affordable price and sound quality is too good..i recommend this for beginners..as i was a beginner  and i was much satisfied with the product thank you amazon..regarding the packing it can ve packed more effeciently..rest of the things are perfect ..we can get a guitar bag extra strings and a pick..love this product,4
"This is the first time i purchase guitar and i find it quite good in this price range. The quality is 5/5. There is no damage on the body.They gave a set of string(as i am a beginner so i dont know the quality of string), two picks, a bag.",4
The look and design is gorgeous. Small and easy to carry. But the guitar didn't last for more than a year. The strings broke during winter. The G string was too hard to tune (maybe it was defective). When i first brought it smelled like paint for more than 2 months.,3
"For the price, I had expected something quite mediocre. I was pleasantly surprised. While I am a complete novice, I have had a guitar before, and this one, sounds nice even when its so new.EDIT: Here is an updateI have had this guitar for exactly 2 months now. I have played it almost every day for maybe half an hour to a couple of hours each time. I have got back to playing the guitar after a gap of about 20 years, and so I am a beginner and have not really ""worked"" the guitar a lot. So, I guess it is just the build quality that is beginning to show. The action of the guitar has increased slowly and now at the 12th fret, the gap between the 6th string and the fret is over 5 mm. Not good. 2 mm would have been nice.Having said that, for a beginner like me, who plays mostly chords playing the low strings as high as the 10th-12th frets is quite uncommon.",4
"Writing my review after 6 months. This is my 1st and still my only guitar. The guitar is really awesome for a beginner, or someone who justs want to play for fun.Do, not hesitate. Just go for it. You, will never regret your decision.Pros.1. The guitar build quality is very good. You will never feel, it is 2000 rupees.2. The strings are long lasting, if used properly.3. That means, the music is also to the right tone.4. The, bag given in the package is also of good quality, though it does not have any padding.5. The guitar is very lightweight and very portable.Cons. Didn't find many.1. The main problem with is guitar, or any other low price guitar is, the tuning does not stay for very long time.But this should not be a problem, as it is always adviced to tune the guitar before playing.Tuning app : Guitar tuna.This will really have some important moments of  your guitar playing future..",4
"Everything is good, not having truss rod but still it's a great deal. Best for beginners me included. Sound quality little bit noisy.",4
It's an alright guitar but go for better one of your budget is higher,3
Free gift,5
"Best guitar for beginners sound quality, design are best",5
"I received the guitar on 18th April. It came just like I expected. The guitar was not broken or damaged and was brand new. It is an extremely low priced guitar intended for beginners or just for practice. It's sound and acoustics is the best part for me. My pros and cons are as follows:Pros :1. Light in weight.2. Really awesome sound considering it's price.3. Stylish4. Low price5. Availability of extra stringsCons:1. The fretboard is made out of plastic!2. Not so good finish. Minor scratches and dents are there.3. High string action (distance btw. Fretboard and strings). Plus, the strings are really hard to press on the first fret.4. No amplifier input plug.5. Extremely thin plectrums.6. Cleaning it with cloth caused some scratches.Overall, it is a very good choice if you want to learn guitar as it is such a good price. If you want quality, go for Pluto, Cort, Ibanez or Epiphone (a bit pricey though)",4
"Best for beginners, defenitely of decent quality although i felt the sound could have been s little more better but for the price paid the product is defenitely a value.",4
The media could not be loaded.,5
Body of the guitar feels small but it's best fit if you are somewhere 4.5ft or 5.3ft. Quality is good as per the price consider. One should buy with having a second thought for quality issues,4
"Product is good, it sounds good,  but....unhappy with the attitude of the courier guy... I work in a hospital..my room number is clearly mentioned in my address...he asked me to pick up the product outside the building, even then I went to pick up the product, I just requested him please drop in my car which is just 50 meters away where he was ...he was unwilling  so I had to carry... this is the first time I experienced such a person..",4
i just loved it,5
"The sound quality is much better at price,you can also tighten the 5th and 6th string a little more to make it sound even better,but remember do not tighten the 1st(thinnest) string to much as it easily breaks. Even if the string breaks do not worry you can purchase more strings individually ora full set. The product has very high action,fingers hurt,but you have to bear the pain and become strong to learn it.",3
Sounds quality it's not good,4
Hmm...  nice for beginners.Sound quality is good.Body looks good. on blackEverything seem nice.Have to admit it. its nice.Value for money product,4
Amazing product,5
"i just bought that guitar on two week ago and after 5 day i got delivery of it. amazone send it via simple packaging, no such air cushions as other says just simple cardboard box as small as guitar..after use of two day i found two small dents on bottom of sound box of guitar which is disappointing also string support on fretboard is made of plastic not wood, but take no unusual effect. the bag provided with was too cheap. i use it to store my guitar in it at home and it starting threading and shredding from third day but provided plectrum and extra string set is looking better....after all guitar sound is very good as compare to this price....look is too shiney and superb black with glossy finishing...i like it...they provided one belt which is also looking good but not much stronger i think it will also be threaded after some months..but they also provided string too for hold guitar belt...i am empress because after seen that it is no need to use ""shoe string"" as many youtubers,, :D :D :Din this price it is near to good guitar..if you think it to have guitar to learn and had low budget i tell you can go with it..value for money",3
"THIS IS THE BEST GUITAR EVER. I JUST LOVE THIS GUITAR. THIS IS THE BEST GUITAR EVER. I JUST LOVE THE PACKING AND I WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZED TO RECEIVE SUCH A DETAILED INSTRUCTION GUIDE ALONG WITH THREE PICKS, SIX EXTRA STRINGS AND THE BAG IS JUST AWESOME. TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS GUITAR. JUAREZ ACOUSTIC GUITAR IS THE BEST.",5
value for money,4
nice quality. looks good too. perfect for beginners. free strings and picks is a good deal. i received guitar with a broken piece of wood inside & ordered replacement. got a very good one within 2 days. good one.,4
This a decent quality guitar . But the dots on it are wrong.The distance between the fret board and string is 4.5 which a very good thing . Good for begginers.The bag given to me smaller than size of guitar . The picks are also of decent quality.,3
"Over-all a good guitar, but didn't receive the strap, picks and string in the package",4
"Good for beginners... No damage part, good packing.",4
"Got this guitar in republic day sale...It's was delivered in three days..in great condition..credit goes to amazon packing it was well packed..The guitar is light and quality is descent..need to take care if you want to use it for long..It's a perfect guitar for beginners and learners..bag and extra strings come handy..I broke one string first day due to improper tuning..but attached the extra string so be careful about that, and this gitar is small than normal guitar ie. It has three frets less only 18 frets so if you are pro guitarist I dont recommend this one...nd the guitar cathes scratches and dust easily as it is black..Sound produced by guitar is also descent..I am beginner too so can't say exactly is the guitar sound perfect..according to me it's goodOver all I would say its a great deal for beginners at low price with good quality guitar..Hope this review helped.",4
I love the guitar because it is beginner friendly and also tuning is easy.,5
Good quality sound quality is good packaging quality is good easy to use and value for money for beginners best low budget guitar for beginners,5
"Look guitar is good according to the price but there are some thing i dont like it example...I don't got any pick, guitar is like used color is removing n dots r not same as shown and also the most important part sound is not good of the guitar but if u r very beginner then its good n if u want to tune this guitar with tunner form app then please dont try it u will end it brokening all the string.... Tell wid experience just set it manually.... Still giving 4 stars for cheap product and delivery on time..",4
I didn't like the packaging because of it guitar got a paint crack too and over all it's a decent guitar though the gap between the fretboard and string is a bit mire than usual so it's require a higher finger pressure to grab it properly,3
Don't buy this even if you're a beginner. There's a high chance of it not lasting for more than 5-6 months,3
The guitar is awesome and playing well. Quality product at affordable price. Liked the sound quality and feel of the guitar. Although better quality of strings could be provided because my upper e string broke within a few days of playing. Packaging was excellent. Overall a good buy.,4
Nice to the price,4
Guitar quality is good but the strings gap from the neck is little bit high..,4
Strings are not accurate and some of are very loose. For beginner it is hard to adjust the strings at some good sound level,3
"As being a beginner myself i found it very helpful at this rate . The only cons that i found is it's quite hard to press the string which is comparatively easier on yamaha counterparts , but as already mentioned for the stated price its a nice choice",4
"This guitar is small, for beginners it is perfect. You can learn on this and then upgrade your guitar. This doesn't have truss rod. Sound is average. The guitar detunes frequently so you have to tune it every other day. The wood which Is used to make this guitar is very light weight and of cheap quality but what can you expect at this price range. I would give it 6/10 overall. But for ₹2200, it is worth it!",3
"I got delivered by today and I was trying to fixed the string then it sudden broke. But it is very good for beginners and it can learn many forms of chords, easy to utilize. The delivered doesn't take much time they reached out before the expected date. But packaging is loose as I received.",4
"I have been using this guitar since more than a week and it is easy to use and learn for beginners, and the as per the price, it is a great product.Edit: I have now been using this guitar for more than three months. It is good for beginners but the quality of the strings and also the sound is not great.",3
"Product is not good even for beginners as the frets don't feel good to hold and the sound also is just like coming out from a toy guitar, put a little more money and buy a better one",1
"This guitar was much better than i was expecting at this lowest peice.The quality of its wood & the black matellic color with shine polish makes it premium.If we talk about its component you will get 2 wire sets & two chip for playing this.it comes also with a carring bag in which you will have a strap to hang it on your sholder.Last & final the sound quality because i,m nat a professional guitar player thats why i cant define the sound quality how it was but i just can say that the guitar was so cheap & its stand on my openion.",4
four star for weak strings,4
This guitar Juarez is really fineI got this just now today..eveningThe resonance is sweet...after so many years.after I lost my guitarto some fellow ..i have been thinking to buy A new one i am neither a.beginner nor a expert..but I play chords beautifully  ..i am 99%..satisfiedWith its sound .the manufacturer should have look afterThe beautification....saddle and pick gaurd are not taken importance.....but ok ......let me wait whether it last long or notThanq.Amajon,4
Nice product using it more than 3 years,4
It's perfect for beginners. But sound quality is not so good. But it's good to start with.,4
Bag quality is not Good and unturned automatically,4
"I did not get a pick. i had to buy it from local market. otherwise the guitar is great. i am a begineer. i loved it. top review says it should have that and this and all but i actually dont have more money to spend for all that extra good quality features, so all i have is 2000, and i am getting a guitar for that is itself a good thing for me. i will just hang it on the wall so it looks good, but don't tell me its not good.",4
Good gift for someone young who wants to start learning,4
very nice,5
Product quality is not so goodPicks are of less quality and very thin,4
"Guitar is good, but it's was defected, some scratches are there with fade colour.",2
This is amazing guitar as I expect... Best guitar for for beginners...,4

The Guitar is very good in this price range but I just wonder how it survived the travel because the packaging was very bad and the outer package was torn very badly..... when I saw the package I thought there is no way the Guitar is intact inside but fortunately it was......,4
"The guitar was delivered in good condition but the bag is way smaller in size, more like a guitalele or ukulele bag. This is ridiculous! How do you expect me to carry it around? Why does every delivery need to have a damage or a missing component? My son has a concert in school and i bought for for that. I guess Amazon expects me to carry is with a guitar strap on and Rockstar my way out!Overall, good guitar for beginners, light body and good size. Good to begin with barre chords and fingerstyle strumming etc.Amazon, will I get some response on the smaller bag please?",4
It is very good product,4
Its nice. Please check the product as soon as it is delivered because I firstly got a defective one. Ordered a replacement. The replaced one is fine and good but the there still remains disappointment as only one pick stick( Idk what it is actually called but the one with which u do the strumming)  is given with it.,3
"Bigginers will love this guitar as it has everything you need to start learning playing it. Comes with extra strings and picks so no worry to loss the pick or breaking of string as you got some backups in the package , thr delivery was good box was secured good, so no need to worry about the package arrive to you broken, length of this guitar comes in mid range so anyone can get started on it, So in the end if you love music and want to learn playing guitar and you happen to read this review right now , But this one, because Im having this guitar myself and I love it",4
Reasons why you should not buy this guitar* Strings are of poor quality*The gap between board and strings is large.* It gives extra strain (pain) to your fingers in comparison with other guitars.*Sound Quality is not as good as you expect.*Build Quality is poor.Reasons why you Should buy this Guitar* It is very cheap.* I looks good.* You are beginner and have tight budget.* At this price it is best.I have used this guitar for around 1 year. But it was never my first priority. Still you can't expect better at this price.,3
Good product and good for beginners,4
Okok,4
Packing was good. There was a small scratch on the back side but no impacting damage. Over all i am satisfied.,5
Its strings are closer to frat board,3
"Looking Good and finishing is also good, bridge part broken with 3 months, required service for repairing.",2
Hsdhjd,5
"I would rather suggest to buy a branded one like Yamaha,coz this guitar will hurt u a lot coz it's action is too high which can make u loose interest in guitarsAnd the finishing is also poor.",4
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I am bit disappointed beacause product was damaged ,Soundbox was damaged on top, IRecord unboxing this Product  for evidence,.",4
"It's a good guitar for this price range. However, the fret markings are missing which would've made it easier to learn.Would recommend buying a capo if you don't have one.",3
It’s an amazing product. Build quality is awesome considering the price point. And it also sounds good after standard tuning is done. I bought the black one and it looks and feels amazing.,4
Good,4
Fine,4
This is a great product for beginnersEasy to learn and good quality!,4
Budget guitar for beginners.,5
Quite a decent guitar for beginners.The sound quality is quite good too.The number of frets is lesser.However it is suitable for learning as a beginner after which you can buy a bigger one.,4
"It's smaller than the usual ones so there are less number of frets on it. It doesn't have 24 frets. For me whis a beggiber it serves the purpose very well. Makes good sound which is at par with the best ones out there and is very lightweight. Build quality and finishing is very good. It's almost hard to believe sometimes that this is just worth 3.2k(that's the price I got this for). Given that u get a set of strings with this along with a strap, 2 picks and cover, it is a very good package. Amazon's service was very good but the delivery guy was a bit weird. Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase.",4
"Actually this is one of the best product with such a reasonable price, and with such a satisfactory outputs, sound is too good , the bagg is of medium quality, you gets 2 picks, and a set of stringstoo , soo to sum up you are geeting a big deal, don't miss it!This is not for pro level guitarist and for any experienced one, this is just in sake of learning and later you may buy a better product than this which are slightly costly",5
I am a beginner in guitar playing. Had a wish since colege days to own a guitar and learn playing it.This guitar is very good for beginners like me. Complete value for money.,4
"This product is not worthy enough to purchase. It's heavily coated with paint to hide the flaws, however after 3 days of keeping it in the same cardboard box in which it was delivered the paint which was already coming out a bit, started to come out a lot on its own revealind the actual material used, the neck of the guitar and most of the material is plastic, not wood. I took the guitar to a professional who confirmed it and clearly said that even the sound from this guitar is not accurate or even close to 'accurate'. I didn't play it yet, took it to get tuned, and it turns out that it cannot be tuned properly as well. The strings even after tightening are loosing their grip and as a result after a point it will break or come out as per what the professional told me. Its not worth at all.. it'd be better to move it and go to a shop and purchase it in person. This is not for either 'Beginners' or anyone.. WORST PRODUCT EVER ORDERED! AND I WANT MY MONEY BACK.. I saved money especially for a guitar and now i regret ordering it..",1
For beginning its good,4
Like,4
Firstly the packing of my guitar was too good it came in a bubble rapped and a corogated box .  Its awsome .. good product for the beginners can be easily tuned and strings can easily be changed. No rocket science. I love it m very happy. I also use it for my photoshoots.  Pre wedding. With my clients,5
I like the guitar but I didn't get the cover of guitar this is a very big mistake that Amazon have made,3
"I am a complete novice to the world of guitaring. Still going by the feel of it I can say I have received a good product for the money I have spent. Looks sleek and has an appealing well polished look. Could instantly start strikeing the cords after a little bit of intutive tuning, and it all sounded soothing and melodious. Packaging requires a special mention as it was simple out of the world! Came in a huuuuuuuge box that was huge enough to contain a 50"" LED inside. It was all wrapped in a never-ending array of miniature sized plastic air cussions, that, as an add on, could serve as an interesting toy, if u have kids in your home. Initially on I could not find the belt, the extra set of strings etc that were mentioned in the product description, and thought they were missing; but shortly after did discover them inside the side pocket on the the guitar bag. Everyone around was happy to take a look at it, and happier still after trying their hands on it ☺. Being a complete novice can't comment much on the technicalities of  it but can say this much: it looks great, feels good to hold on to, sounds melodious and brigs a smile on the faces of people around. Highly recommended!",5
"If you are looking out to buy an economical and a clear sounding acoustic guitar , please go ahead and get this. I was a bit skeptical about buying this guitar considering its low price and unknown brand (Juarez) , but ..Boy!! This exceeded my expectations. please look inside the pocket of guitar cover for you accessories and extra strings!! And delivery condition was amazing, as some one already posted with pictures, when the order reaches us, we will all have this question, who the hell ordered a huge LCD screen TV??? but, beware...that's your guitar packed in a giant package to prevent it from damages. so, i'd say, go for it and happy strumming. cheers amigos.",4
"Seems good for this price, need to keep tuning it but otherwise sound is fine. It’s light weighed and small thus easy to hold. Packaging in which it came wasn’t too impressive, good that there wasn’t any breakage or defect.",4
For beginners it is great product. I received my product in good condition so iam very happy with the product. Sound quality is so nice for begineer level. Packinging also good. You can happily buy this product.,4

Quality is poor,3
Worst quality,1
"This guitar is mainly for the beginners! Once you learn how to play it, you won't feel to play this one. This guitar is smaller than the original size of acoustic guitar. So, you can buy this one if you are a beginner!",4
This is unexpected on this price,4
Very good design and best for beginners 👍,4
"This is a good product if you are a bit familiar with a guitar and want a something in a low price range, you can go for it. If you are an absolute beginner I would suggest you to go for a little better quality because beginners need to get some success initially​ to keep their interest and morals high, I'm writing this because you might get to struggle with the fret board initially with this product, with some effort you can get used to it, Amazon delivery was spot on, nice packaging and amazing service.",4
Very good product on low budget for beginners .The only fault is that in the pic plectrum is shown but they give only guitar and bag,3
The price is affordable and quality is not that bad. Its working fine. I purchased this guitar for my kid who is moody so not sure if he will continue to learn guitar in long run so for me this was good option to buy as the price suits my pocket.. and its have been 6 months using it. No regrets,4
"Nice Guitar, my suggestion is learn it then play because if you don't know how to play after purchasing, it my effect both your interest and confidence.",4
You should tune the guitar before use . It doesn't come with tuned guitar strings and you can I do in only (DIY) home using 3rd party apps to tune,4
Nice product,3
I purchased this guitar as a beginner. It's third day and i didn't played much and the first string already broken. The action is high so you have to press hard which is painful for fingers. Sound is good and it's cheap too but now i think i should have purchased a good one,3
Fast delivery good for beginners thanks अमेझॉन,3
"My review is divided into two parts.1st - about amazon.>> best e-commerce website with all genuine products>> delivery of product is more safer than car airbags>> packaging was excellent, not even a single scratch on product.>> one day delivery.2nd  - about product>> product is good for beginners.>> quality is cheap, but you can't expect much at this price range.>> only issue I had is that standard guitar strings doesn't need to press that hard as this guitar strings required to hold down.>> it doesn't sound exactly what standard guitar sounds like,but it's an medium size guitar and as per price it is satisfactory product.Conclusion >> if you are beginner then go for it, professionals anyways don't look for guitar at this price range.>> if you want to buy good quality guitar at this price range then buy second hand guitar (olx), you will definitely find much more good quality product than this one.",3
obusly its not great but value for money. good for those who just want to learn basic guitar skills.,3
"The sound quality is too awesome for the price range, the only issue is the distance of string and board",5
The product broke within 2 to 3 uses... the screw was fixed with glue instead of being fixed properly. Completely dissatisfied with the product.Putting a complain with the seller now.,1
Great for beginners and kids who wants to learn guitar,3
Thank you so much for lovely guitar. i would like to suggest you can buy this product if you are beginner. do not go for expensive guitar. Its take 2 or 3 month for being perfect.,5
Fantastic & fabulous :)Good sound quality & great build quality.Best quality for beginners and professional career.,5
Although the action (distance between fret board and string) is little high but its really okay once you train your fingers for it.Don't expect a high brand quality but its value is wonderful for this price and is perfect for beginners.If you are a beginner then go for it!!Some people are having problem regarding strap attachment...  Attaching strap is quite simple:One end goes at the bottom knob and other end is ties to a string provided in the pack and the string is tied to the neck!!,4
Worth for the price......body is too good .....color is as shown the problem was with the strings.....they were not tuned....it took much time for me to tune it correctly....if it happen with anyone u can tune with guitar tuna app ......,4
"The product comes in well packed state and it have to be tuned after unpacking, The sound quality is good, in such a low price, the look of guitar is good in appearance and well structured, i suggest you to buy it with other doubts, and enjoy this acostic guitar from juarez.",4
I don't have any idea regarding guitars.I have gone through all sites and bought this one. Actually it looks great and sound quality is good and good for beginners like me.worth buying for beginners at this price,4
Best for beginners and im satisfied,4
This guitar was initially delivered with broken strings.the eagerly awaited replacement came but the base was unstuck in sich a way as to make it impossible to use. Very disappointing gift for my grandson. Still hoping this time the problem is sorted and he receivesa good guitar,3
I would have given it five stars but the quality of the material used is a littpe cheaper...ofcourse at this prize u cant expect too much..but still...Overall the product is good ...its more than enough for beginners...as  i m one of them....The packing by tue amazon is just amazing...i mean hats off amazon really.....amazon might have done phd or something in packing...But packing was too goodAnd one tip..Dont try to set up the guitar urself....i mean i broke a string by tightning it too much so.. :),4
Amazing product! Sound quality is good.  Make is beautiful. Genuinely satisfied with the product.,4
It's values for money product. Brought this for 1800/-Product was delivered with a good condition,5
It's really a good one for beginners.My string broke on the very first day.It would be better if u change the strings and start practicing. All the beginners just give it a try😉,4
"Firstly I got a damaged Guitar after replacement I got new guitar which was damn good and the sound is so so perfect but it's pick is made up of plastic because of it, guitar produces harsh sound so I request u not to Provide plastic picks it gives a beginner wrost experience although it's good product",4
This iss actually a good one for beginners and for advanced players as well. However I did not liked its sound quality and the wires. They were very thin as compared to a high end guitar.,4
"Overall good for new learners..build quality is too low,when i opened the packing  with full excitement, inside the guitar was damaged..Can you atleast provide a good protectice covering,as most of the guitars are cracked😏",3
"I bought this guitar for a family member who was interested in learning to play the guitar. The sound is alright though the bass isn't as deep and pronounced. Its body is smooth and looks much more premium than the price suggests. The action between the strings and the fretboard is quite low making it easy to hold chords and play cleanly without much effort.However, I had a problem with the tuning pegs upon changing strings. That's about the only issue so far.",4
I have started learning guitar 6 months ago and I am glad i selected this one. I brought it to impress my crush. I wanted to play her favourite Enrique song (Somebody's me). The quality of this product is ultra good for biggenners. (Especially if you are only aiming to learn handful of songs). It was super difficult in the beginning but I have learned 5 songs till now. This guitar has served it's purpose ☺️.,5
"I liked it because it is making justice to it's price, overall quality is good I have it for around 2 years but it's still working well. It comes with extra strings and Cove.",4
Absolute for bigginer good quality,4
"I bought it for my kid. I got it for Rs.1700/- and that is the price of just a toy!Pros:1. The guitar is good looking, light weight, a bit small. Suited for kids.2. Cover, straps, picks and extra strings were there as promised.Cons:1. Fret board uneven. The dots for the 3rd 5th and 7th are protruding out, making bends and slides almost impossible without getting hurt.2. No truss rod and the fret-board is bent. Natural harmonic and fretted note at the 12th fret for all the strings are off by almost a semitone.3. Frequent de-tuning.The guitar could be a good starter for a slide guitar novice .It  is quite ok if you just want to sing along playing chords. (Do not mix top fretted chords and open chords with bottom fretted chords in a song, it will be almost a semitone off.)Three stars are for the price, looks and accessories.",3
"Appearance wise it would be very appealing. The sound quality is not up to the mark. The product quality is not at all good. A little jerk would actually put a dent on the guitar, not a scratch but directly a dent.Please don't buy it, don't waste money. Look for other options.",3
"This is the best guitar one could get in this range. Totally suitable for absolute beginners. The wood quality is excellent, the strings are great and hence the sound quality is amazing. For enthusiasts, who are looking to start learning guitar, this is the best buy. I'm very happy and satisfied with this product.",5
Guitar is delivered in nice condition although its packaging very poor & unsafe for long transportation. I have got only One ( 1 )Guitar Pick but not 2 as described in the display and without any Extra string as promised by Amazon choice. Over all built in quality in best at this prices and I am satisfied to gift it to my son on his birthday.,4
A very awesome Guitar at this range! Well builted guitar work! And sound quality is awesome..! If You Are A beginner then You Should Go For This!! Love Juarez!!❤❤,4
Price ans make is perfect for beginners but the G string was faulty in the Guitar I got. Despite taking to various shops the same could not be tuned and as a result guitar is of no use.Pls consult a guitarist before buying rather going for the price attraction.,2
Nice quality of sound .... You can too go for it .....just being a beginner I like it so much,4
"Delivered before time ,Product is exactly as mentioned on the display, Good quality materials including the cover bag and belt, Thanks to Amazon, Keep it up",4
Nice for beginners,4
"I'm writing this a couple of days after delivery, and so far, I haven't had any trouble.Delivery-I'm very pleasantly surprised; it arrived within 24 hours as promised. Prime ftw.The packing was immaculate. A hard box, with the guitar covered and bubble-wrapped. The guitar bag was wrapped up in the box, along with the plectrums (0.71 mm), extra strings, and the guitar strap. The guitar itself was largely intact; it had a couple of tiny scratches, but they're so small, I couldn't even get a clear enough picture. It has metal strings and the knobs turn smoothly without resistance. Tuning the guitar didn't take long, and the resonance sounds pretty great.It's a simple sort of an instrument, without the frills of a Fender acoustic to adjust volume and tone, but for about 2k, with all the add-ons, I think it's an absolute steal.",5
"I don't know why the people write the negetive review about the product .Anyways I Bought this product keep thinking in mind ""Pta nahi kaisa hoga"". But once i got the guitar all doubt gone down. Guitar looks stylish for me , I am new to Guitar So i tuned it firstly and tried to play and it just rock. Good sound produces. I am happy. But yes need for caring like a baby :D as this is light weight. but worth of this price tag.",4
just buy it only if you are a biggner!!!!!!!!!!!Cons !!1... Small2... 18 frets3... treble4... no belt knob on guitar5.. buy 24 frets or less not 186.. the distance between the string base in  front of thee guitar hole the distance is too much if you have to playbuy fingers (thumb picking) there is no place to rest your hand because the distance is too much (if you have a guitar only then you would understand ..6..)Pros1.. made presizly for biggners2...light3.. string action is close so learning cords gets easy4.... cheap ... first learn then buy an expensive 1 s5....worth the money i say bang of it6... its china made but quality is firmsorry for the english social media has ruined my vocabulary..  i suggest buy 1 for around 5 k from a retailer with someone who knows about this machine,3
"I was using this guitar for more than 6 months and I didn't found any problem for beginners.Yes it has some mistakes while making the guitar such as high distance between the fretboard and strings, dots on the guitar, total number of frets, hardness of strings, scratches on the body, small dent on body etc. But what you can expect to get in 2000rs.Still It is good for beginners who have small budget for learning the guitar. You can purchase this guitar for learning the basics and can use it for maximum 4 to 5 months and then move on for Yamaha, Cort or Fender guitars.",3
"Peg were not fixed, strings were not fixed",3
It is good for begginers..👌👍,4
it has been a year i had bought it is in a very good condition as in looks but i never knew hat it is painted ......i thought is the wood in whole but it was not and the paint in the edges are getting out and main thing is the strings are not tuning,3
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I liked nothing just need a refund",1
I like the colour and design of this product. It will be a good start for beginners sound quality is good but I've received my order already opened packaging the outerbox was already opened and the guitar has many spots (colour fades) although I know it is an average quality product but you guys should packed the product well.,3
The string is not good quality,1
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Body of the guitar is not much good, Color may be getting out after some days. It's may be break.",1
Colour feds up soo easily just by putting hand on it.,1
Best to beginners,5
Poor quality of string nd bag,3
I like the guitar but deliver is not good because I haven't my pick for guitar in package....nd in app they show us pick is already inserted. But I can't see my pick hear...What can I do...??,3
Fabulous,4
VERRY EXELENT GUITAR ON THIS PRICE RANGE SOUND IS GOOD BODY IS GOOD STRINGS ARE GOOD In short everything is awsome and you get a carry bag for guitar free with it !!!!!!!💰💰💰💰VALUE FOR MONEY 💰💰💰💰,5
"The guitar is good, but I received the guitar bag with broken zip, and the size of the guitar bag is not suitable to this middle, the guitar is not going / fitting in the bag, kindly arrange for the other bag.If you provide the offers with giving free the bag with low quality, which is not made for this guitar size, why such offers you give with the guitars, ...please sort my query.",3
Liked,4
Best guitar at its price....must buy good product,4
"This is has the best sound quality, but apart from that, the structure of the guitar is very hard especially the fret board. Wouldn't recommend it for beginners. So to speak about its fret board alil high making the string rise up.",3
"i bought it for my 10yr old kid. it was the best ecnomical option considering the uncertainty of1. whether she would continue learning the guitar.2. she getting used to handling a  exp instrument.the finish does feel cheap, but so are guitars at 5k.i would buy a better brand if it was not for a beginner.reviewers should not be comparing it with a 10k guitar and complain about it.",4
"Good product at the given price . There is however one problem with the product delivered to me ...there is only one hook for the strap , the other hook is missing. And also the white border arpund the guitar body should have had a better finishing . Other than that the sound is really at this price and the guitar being a small one comes in very handy and comfortable to hold and play specially for new beginners . Packaging is really good .",4
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I purchased this product for ₹1649 in Amazon Great Indian Festival.This guitar is totally awesome for beginners. Build quality is super. Quite best stuff at this range of price. I was worried about the delivery of this product, thought that there may be damages while handling this product from the place of origin to the destination place . But all went wellA total thumbs down for packing👎👎The outer box wasn't sealed well with Amazon's packing tape and the bill was totally crushed.",4
"It is good guitar for extreme beginners. The action is kind of very high and you can feel it while playing. But the sound it creates is nice at this price range but if you have a better budget, go for other brands and dreadnought size...in small size guitar without trust rod like this it is very difficult to adjust the action. I have to taper my bridge several times but still my fingers hurts",4
"Product is good and as per the specifications.AS described in the order, extra Strings and Picks are missing in the pack.Kindly check.Thank youa",3
Guitar are good.Single dent is not present.Very attractive,5
I like it,3
"The item is extremely good for beginners. Comparing to the price of the item , this is a perfect deal. If you have just started playing a guitar go ahead with the item.",4
"Good sound, great feel.Doesn't have a truss rod which adjust the neck. So have to keep it untune after playing. After an year or so the guitar was bent to front and was unable to play Barr chords. Good for 1 year or max 2 years",5
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I liked the size of guitar which is compatible for all learners. Also, sound quality is good. Guitar with this price range will all features, great deal!!!Mike socket is not there in guitar.",5
"Its good for beginners as it gives sound nicely but tunning it is a little hard, over-all good so far",4
"I am playing guitar for 17 years and I haven't seen a Bad guitar like this one ever.  This is not even a real guitar. It is simply a toy. The fretboard is a joke. It was arrived neck broken, never mind.  The quality is awful too. It is very light, the neck was loosely attached and the wood was very bad,I need a refund, I don't want replacment.Simply don't buy it. Waste of money.Re. The situation becomes pathetic when the refund part comes, they simply avoided pickup telling verification failure and didn't also replaced the order.  Nuisance is going on here.",1
"Good one but only for beginners ofcourse.Just one suggestion, buy it in deals time if there is no rush, you will get very good discount.",4
Super,4
"The presentation of the product was not good. A lot of cardboard was wasted, the cover was scratched and the writing on the cover is just falling off. I would like it if it was in the price range of ₹1500.",4
Nice guitar still working,4
The best product👌🏻👌🏻Superb😍..........Best sound quality...,4
Guitar tuning is not working defective both time. Not happy with product quality.,1
"This guitar is priced exceptionally well for what it is. Its a boon for someone who's new to the guitar world and is pretty easy to play after you practice a lil bit.Overall, highly recommend.",5
It's good for the beginner....The product was great but they don't give all the product......,3
"It's fun to start knowing the different  sounds from each string, good to develope interest for music and learn",4
"It's a good guitar for this price. But, one of my stirng got broken so early, that's why 3 stars, and also I had to press the strings little but harder which hurts a little more.Apart from that ,this guitar is all good.",3
"Overall guitar seems good but the only problem is that the distance between freck and strings are very much due to which high action is needed which cause pains in finger after some time.If you can afford 1-2K more,then purchase a good one instead of it.",3
Easy to learn to the tune.,4
"Hi This is the most awesome guitar for the begginersthe product really works well and also well designed.. Worthy product at this price.. If u r looking a guitar for practice blindly go ahead and order this guitarIts sound good. Built quality good. Its came up with a guitar cover, two nos of pic, guitar holding strap, and one set of six nos string",5
"First off, this is an insanely cheap product. So keep that in mind. The fretboard is completely flat so it's really hard to play bar chords.The sound quality is okay at best. The steel strings are really poor and both pairs snapped very quickly for me. But that was okay since a good set will only cost you ₹350. If you are not sure about investing in a good guitar yet, this is will do the job.",3
"Good presentation.Average built quality.Average sound quality.In less than 2k it's worth the money.If you are a beginner like me who don't have more than 2k, can buy this Guitar or If you are like me who's not sure whether you can make a habit of playing guitar every day can buy this. But if you get serious about learning Guitar eventually in few months you have to upgrade this.",3
It just broke,1
I would say it is working fine till now. I dont even expect an item of this price to last this long.  So for beginners..yes you can go for it.,4
Product nice but in 3rd string is not assemble. It's a dammage string cable.,4
Excellent 👍👍👍 I even started playing this every where I go.I don't have much knowledge about guitar but after purchasing this I started giving coaching to 1000+ students Arjit Singh is one of them.Justin is also coming to India just for my Wonderful lessons thank you Amazon for making my life special 😍😍😍Guitar is just awesome 👍,5
"You get what you pay for, if you are a beginner ""don't buy"". Get something better probably a F310 by Yamaha. I bought this to have something to play while i am at my parents house. Not my primary guitar.",3
Best Sound quality🥰,5
"Quality is not that much good, but 1.5k to 2k is worth",4
"first of all, i would like to tell this...""WORTH THE MONEY...!!"" I got this awesome guitar for Rs.1990/- only. I didn't expect or find any guitar at this price range and in this quality..!! Am a total beginner and this is the first time am holding a guitar..and man..this feels so awesome..fits n sounds perfect..!! all the accessories are included with good quality(strap+replacement strings+picks+nylon bag).DON'T FORGET TO TUNE YOUR GUITAR BEFORE EVERY SESSION..& ALSO KEEP YOUR GUITAR CLEAN FOR LONG LASTING..PROS: LIGHT WEIGHT, WELL BUILT QUALITY, NICE WORKMANSHIP, SOUNDS GOOD IN THIS PRICE, BUILD QUALITY IS AWESOME.CONS: PAINT IS A BIT PEELING OFF(BUT NOT AN ISSUE)SUGGESTIONS: DO BUY A TUNER ALONG WITH THIS GUITAR...!! I WOULD PREFER THIS TUNER.. 
Kadence Digital Chromatic Tuner for Guitar, Bass, Violin & Ukele
I would recommend this one if you are a complete beginner and don't wanna invest more money... :) hope my review helps in choosing a right guitar.....GO FOR IT GUYS..!! :)",5
"I was worried about how this guiter will be. when i opened i was so shocked 😲. it just amazing 🤩. i never played guiter before.i bought this just for keeping me busy sound quality,durability,looks just awesome.i am using yousician and justin guiter app for learning.i am so happy with amazon and juarez 😊.Thank You.🙏",5
The gears behind the tuning pegs are made of plastic which is a major drawback. And also one of it broke the second day while tuning the guitar also it won't allow the guitar to stay tuned for a longer period of time.,3
"This is not a full size guitar, good for learner in the age group upto 10 yrs. I have not yet tried to tune it. I consulted my music teacher and he suggested to return it, unfortunately I am stuck with it. He suggested me to buy Granada guitar model no PRS-1 39"" acoustic.",4
"If you never touched any guitar before, so this is the best you can get at this price. If you want to learn the guitar for the first time then go for it otherwise if you aren't a begginer then you should probably get some better guitar around 5k or more.",4
Is too small  I think is size is big but ....,3
"Its one of the best quality guitar for beginners.Its build is not thay great , i mean when Carry it it feels really light but the quality of the wood i would say is not upto tje mark u just have to give more care to it.Bht anyway its the nice one to purchase under 2300 .Go for it without any second thought.",5
"Guitar was too good! Worth for price, but little damage in body and worst backpack... because back pack is too small",4
The product is seems to very nice. The material is also very good. It's perfect for beginners. Some of chords are hard to set that's why I give 4 stars.,4
I ordered acoustic guitar of juarez after my friend suggested it but I got a defect one...i don't know guitar my friend who is a expert came to help me in tuning the guitar... He looked at The tuning screw and it's broken .... I was super excited to look at the guitar I didn't look at the details. Ordered for a replacement let's see what will happen,3
"The guitar is very good.and its quality is also very good.its the best guitar and its price is also so good.i am very happy with it,but the only thing i didnt liked is the guitars covers chain was broken only this is my dislike.but the guitar is very good you can buy it without any hesitation or any worry of quality or price.",5
"I got delivery last week, but it was found with crak. I requested for return and within one week I got new one.I am perfectly satisfied. Good for entry level.",4
"Amazon's packaging is always good. The guitar is good for beginners learning chords. Check with the price, you can't compare others with that price",4
I think the product is fantastic but the sound quality is not soo good as expected...all over the guitar is good...But the 1st day I bought it my strings just broken but let it be the guitar was good 😊☺️❤️,3
Overall it's a nice product under 2000 but After 4 days of playing this is 3rd string had broken But Amazon has already provided another string free of cost so thanks to it....The bag is the best and belt is also the best..... But there is some color are faded ..... But according to my opinion it's a best product under 2 thousand.....,4
"It's good for beginners , also affordable,",3
I like its appearence but it shows many scretches and i find many scratches first time after opening the guiter pacage😐🤔I think it was used and the strings are not at all good😅😥😥😥😥😓😓😓😓😓😓😓😓,3
Best as per Price....,4
There was no bag neither extra strings with it ! Hope u guys will replace this and send the missing items with the new one,4
Sound quality  is so awesome  but they have no truss rod,1
"First of all I got this Guitar in 1999/- only. I have checked in Marked & I did not found basic guitar in less than 3000. So 1999/- deal is very good & for this I really thanks to AMZON.As I am completely new eyt to learn the Guitar, so for new person like me its really good deal.The Guitar was packaged so well as i got Biiiiig box like 40 inch TV. Guitar was well protected in the box. Image has shown white stripes on Guitar, but I received full black Guitar & it looks very awesome & cool. Guitar is in black glossy color.Image has shown 2 pics but i got 3 pics in the Guitar cover as well as extra 5 strings.Guitar Cover is looks so so, but at the rate of 1999/- it is very good.Overall in this rate you will not get guitar like this in Market.Go for It...",5
"My experience with this wasn't much great, just after opening this when is used it, it's string broke within a split second.",4
It's good for the price being offered but isn't quite what I though. The zip and the strap of the bag broke the very first day.Not very good for beginners as the there isn't the acoustic kind of reverb because of the wood being used.,3
"For someone who wants to seriously learn, may be you can spend a bit more.My main problem with this is that the Fret to String distance(Action) is too much!The frets are almost flat to the board and hence you need to press hard.Its difficult to play Barre chords due to the requirement of pressing the string too hard.",3
"Hello guys, A sound quality is very good. Easy to learn. And best guitar for beginners to learn.",5
"I am a non-guitarist person and wanted to gift this guitar to my husband who has knowledge of music and instrument of all kind.It was a Diwali gift and received exactly on the day of Diwali.. what else you want? Perfect delivery !!!Guitar looks nice and has all descriptive items with it.However, my all happiness went to a toss when I saw the size of Guitar.. It is indeed beautiful & perfect for a kid but not for a grown up person.So if you want to get this for your kid (till age of 15) its worth.. else please spend a little more and get a better guitar..Thanks Amazon for the perfect delivery, bound to return the product !!",3
"Reviewing after few weeks of use- This is the best budget guitar, I've bean used signature's guitar since 2 years and bought this , found it's quality upto the mark, sond is so pure..just tune properly, and the best part- very very attractive glossy colour.❤️thank you Amazon.",5
Sting are not applied successfully,3
Not good,1
"When guitar was delivered it had only 1 carboard packaging. Due to which it got damaged a bit. Its just the paint job but packaging could be and should be better, as its delicate product.Given price range, sounds good.",3
Good buy,4
Guitar is one size small if it had been 40+ inches then i think price would be best but yes for biggner it is okay NOT RECOMMEND FOR TALL ( ABOVE 6 FEET 2 INCHES) AND HEALTHY SIZE,4
I would suggest all the beginners as well as even regular performers to have this guitar!  The quality is of topmost class and it doesn't hurt much while using the metal strings and it's really easy to pick any tune/chord of any song as its compact as compared to other biG GUITARS! Highly Recommended for Beginners!🔥🔥🙌,5
It's very easy to learn specially for the beginners.And the best part is the sound quality.i would highly suggest you to just give this product a try .Thank you !,5
Gap between string and fret board is too high so hard to play,4
"Everything is great , sounds very good  , packaged well and was delivered in 3 days ( ignoring due to lockdown) . Literally I don't know how to play but learning A chord today was very painful and my finger tips are paining too much as well. But later on that habit would develop. So overall a nice product in nice budjet.",5
"Very nice and cute guitar. Finishing and color also super. I'm very much happy with this guitar. Packing is awsome. From amazon side evrything  perfect. But deliver side was worst. They are not professional et al. The product reached Bangalore 2 days before the expecting date but courier people could not deliver the product, i personaly followed  and remind them to deliver the product. Plz develop ur delier side. At the end im very much happy.",4
It a really nice guitar at Rs2150. It is good for beginners. Sound is also good. It would have been better if the guitar came tuned.,4
The bag is torn the print on the guitar is gone and there is no pick and string set delivered which was mentioned in the details,2
I'm too much happy with this product. Overall experience shopping from amazon was very fantastic. the packaging of product is also good. Happy with this product.,5
Good looks but bend it soon there is no chance to resolve it,1
"It is smaller than a regular size guitar , very delicate.. And there is no neck nut so the neck may bend in few months, but I'm satisfied , what more you can expect in such a price.. I bought it in just 1790 rupees so I'm happy...If you are a beginner with a very tight budget then I can recommend this to you.But the amazon packaging is very pathetic.",4
Hi you all who are buying this it’s the best one yet but the devery boy broke mine so I applied for the new one first of all it’s the best guitar I have ever had the finishing is awesome so if you are playing for that just don’t think go for this one that’s it,5
"Guitar is Too good I love it.......But damage in 3 days....Here’s what you need to know before you read this review; first, I am not a professional musician/guitar player; however, I consider myself quite a musical person and I do own a few musical instruments including some Casio and Yamaha keyboards, flutes and have owned some very professional musical studio equipment including sound boards like AWE64 and 32 from Creative; of course, I have reviewed tons of these kind of things in the past.So, I have done quite a bit of messing around, just not a ‘professional’ type; keep that in mind. So, if you are looking at this guitar, probably you are starting out, or you simply don’t want to spend too much money on getting one of the bigger brand names; whatever, it is I hope this review helps you decide.What I liked",5
"Awesome guitar at this price.. bought during diwali sale at rs 1999 only.As I am a absolute beginner it is perfect for me to practice.size 38 inch is also good. And the sound is also nice.just go for it.Got delivered before diwali though delivery date was scheduled for 2 nov.. fast delivery by Amazon as always 5 stars for that.And the packaging. Salute you amazon for that. 5his product was in such a big box my neighbours and relative thought it may be LED tv 😂. It was in a big big big box.. and safely delivered. The product was also fresh and unused. Totally satisfied with product.And yes, I feel proud I am a prime member of amazon.. Amazon's customer support is soo so good no one can beat that.. thank you very much..overall 5 stars rating.. you are perfect..flipkart is still your child and always be..😂.",5

Best for beginners.  Compact size will be helpful for beginners. At this price range this is value for money.,4
Nice guitar but sound quality is not that much.. but for beginners its good,3
The string get  loose soon,4
This guitar is cheap that is the advantage but This product is not for beginners who want to really learn guitar for professional purpose..Rather I would say there are better guitar available,4
it came with big package and my brother loves it alot ❤️❤️❤️thank you amazon you are helping us to fulfill dreams in lockdown,4
Best to start with it.Very light in weightString is good.Sound- I am really not satisfied with it. But I will visit my teacher and ask about if we can change it or do change in the string settings,5
I'm a beginner and this is my first guitar. I find no problems with this product. I snapped my string twice but I think it may be my error.,5
This guitar is  good for beginners though the product has some or the other default.My guitar was broken and it's paint was out but I am satisfied with it.Recommended for those who want good in less amount.,3
Worth of 2500₹,4
"If you're willing to have a guitar and not very much into music then this guitar is perfect.better than any thing you can get in around 2k.now as far as guitar is concerned it's nice, quality is good, sound is prety decent, but action is a bit high so you might find it hard to play bare cords , overall it's very good.if you're beganer and putting your hand first time on guitar you might find it hard for 2-3 days or even week but don't quit after some time it'll be easy.now if you want a guitar and tight on budget go for this without having a second thought but if you can afford more then leave this and buy yamaha f310 because that will be with you for longer time.",5
Distance between string and fret board is comparitively more. Tail and tuning pegs are of plastic. Apart from that...good one..Edited after three weeks.....the tuning pegs back tooth broked....I have to buy new ones..that cost 500,3
West,3
Sound quality is not same like other guitar,3
"It is good , but it's very hard to practice. And the guitar sound is also not soo good . More or less , it is like a toy",3
This guitar is a must guy guitar for all kind of learners especially for beginners.I bought this one a month ago and by the experience of learning to play it regularly I would say it is a perfect one.It is very comfortable and Handy. Go for it.,4
This is awesome pr jb mene yehi product offer pr 1600rs me mngvaya to muze Mila nhi boht bura lga or 7 days tk wait kraya pr 2000 me bhi acha hai 😍😍 Bhai fingers pain hadd hota hai 😫😫,4
"It's ok for beginners,and cost is valuable price well,looks good ,but.....Product guaranty was doubt ,because it's too thin materials for broken chances are most",4
"After using it for 1 year, I am writing this review...Pros:Sound Quality: It produces crisp, loud sound.Design: It is a small guitar with cutaway design and it's easy to carry.Cons:Lack of trusrod: There is no trusrod in the guitar. Once the neckbending starts, it's hard to repair or continue playing.Bass: The material is very thin and there is no bass if you thump.Build Quality: The build material is very average.Overall it's a good guitar to start with but if you build interest you have to save bucks for a better one.Thank you",3
Good for starters . But e string was off when i bought it .12th fret has wrong dots. Sound was kind of dull when bought. D and g string were rusted. But good for starters and simple fingerstyle.,3
It is good acoustic guitar for begginers. It is not so costly as  other professional guitars. You can learn with the help of YouTube so if you want to learn guitar you can pick this one cheapest guitar,4
"It ok in this price point but it's not for long time use, you use only 3-4 months and then is destroyed",2
This guitar is perfect for beginners. At the price of Rs. 1990 (lightning deal) you can't get anything better. The finish of the guitar is great and sounds good for the price. The strings are going to be tough on your fingers in the beginning 2 days then it becomes less harsh and comfortable to play.This guitar is a bit compact and has less frets than normal which is fine for me as it complements my stature :DI'm happy with the purchase. And the extra accessories are a plus and the bag quality is decent too.A con- There's no hook for the strap but i got it fixed at my local guitar repair shop.,5
"Guitar is good for beginners just ho for it blindly, but dont trust amazon service they still sucks....",4
i am totally a newbie. The sound is so amazing.The color quality is amazing but parts are cheap thats totally fine cuz this is a very cheap guitar. Has few small dents and scratches. But thats okay for me cuz its working totally fine. Tunning was difficult cuz this is my first guitar plus the app GuitarTuna is not working properly.Overall nice guitar seems delicate though,4
"Always wanted to Have a Guitar. Came across this one the Sale day, at an awesome price. After receiving the Guitar I went on to see some reviews, and they all were positive reviews.Now from my experience.Pros:Best value for moneyGood DesignSound is excellent at its category.Excellent for beginners. (I am going to start my guitar lesson with this one.)Accessories are add on.Cons:NothingThough packaging should have been betterBeginner's don't think just go ahead. Wont Repent. Will cherish your purchase decision.If my review helped you, please hit ""Helpful"". Thanks",5
"Ordered it for my 12 yrs boy,  he is very happy with it,Packing was very good, arrived one day before, thanks amazonquality is very good , looks like premium stuff, got it around 2200 in lightnings dealNeed to tune it, visited to near by guitar class for tuning as well as quality check, person told that at 2200 you have got very good pieceI am happy, go for it",4
Unable to tune it properly.Any tips,3
Bahut hi acha guitar hai lekin stings ki quality achi nhi hai,5
"The product is a value for money product and if u read any bad reviews then please ignore cause this occurs to only 2-5 people in thousands.The product is a great one for the people who are willing to start their carrer or for intrests.The package contains the details all described so we can say that there is nothing negative in the product.Also if you will maintain the guitar then it will last long.Just in short, as this price I can bet that tou are not going to get this product anywhere in this world.",5
Good product.market prize is 1450/- to 1700 in Mumbai.,4
Nice for begginers ....but your delivery boy's behaviour is too bad ...If the behaviour remains the same then I will not buy anything from Amazon...,4
Guitar is good but strings are worst as when I started to play strings are breaking. Strings are of worst quality,4
"Speaking about the plus point  for this guitar , It have a classy look , good sound , good for beginners .There is one negative point which is the gap between the frets & the strings which seems to be little high , other wise for this price range , nice 1 go ahead buddies",4
"Hi, I got the product now, but the packaging was veryy disappointing, and moreover, the guitar bag that I received is such a bad quality, that just got holes and the chain of the brand new bag didn't even work. The tunes weren't set which I feel wouldn't be. Overall I am not happy with the packaging. The guitar looked beautiful though.",2
"Good, Things I ordered is good and according to my expectations.",4
Very bad it's defect I want to return plzz return my parcel,1
"Body frame is cheap material I think, but looks so good...worth the price",5
Recieved it broken bought it because thought it was good for the price but can get better guitars offline stores for slightly higher price than this so dont recommend it,2
"Just received this guitar (27 Nov 2018). The finish is flawless, nothing is broken, nor there are any holes in it.But the first thing I noticed was the rust on one of strings.Please see image, the dark parts on string is rust.Please help.Should I get it replaced or is it common?",4
"It is easy to use and light weight guitar.You can send the features here:-Black Glossy Finish, Number of Frets: 18, Acoustic Guitar with strap, Bag, Strings and 2 PicksGreat looks with an innovative design to produce good quality soundFinger board: Linden Wood, Fretboard - Ebony Wood, Size: 38 inches, CutawayIncluded components: Acoustic Guitar with strap, Bag, Strings and 2 PicksLinden Binding and Full Wood Construction with Geared Tuning, Wood Frame and Steel StringsI Hope you like my review please 👍👍👍",5

"Juarez Acoustic Guitar, 38 Inch Cutaway, 038C With Bag, Strings, Pick And Strap, Black
I bought this in the month of 1 september 2018 and received on 7 sept 2018.Packaging was excellent and on time delivery.Now coming to guitar it is really good.  sound is very fine. Good for beginners as 38"" will help you to understand better and easy to handle.neck bridge fretboard all have designed good.i must recommend to all the beginners to go with this guitar first then switch to higher version.thankyou amazon.",5
"It is just for beginners.The product is not of great quality but it is what you get for the money you will pay.It will cost you less and it will help you practice if you are a novice.It is difficult to tune it because the wood is very light and it is not properly calibrated.If you do not want to invest too much and just want to test your guitar skills, this is the guitar for you.",3
Breaked guitar,1
Good one for beginners,4
"Playing guitar for about 9 years now, bought it for my little student, guitar sound is good but fret distances aren't accurate. You can't get the accurate sound. If you want a guitar for room decoration then you can buy it. Guitar is so delicate but looks good.",3
Not play well,3
Invest 2000 more and buy a branded guitar. Life of this guitar is not much,2
Perfect,5
Very nice 👌👍👌👍,4
"All those beginners out there, this product is for us. Buy it without any hesitation. Its nice in all the ways and the best part of it is that it is tuned so, you don't have to take the pain of tuning it. Just unwrap it and indulge to fulfill your passion. It comes in a large box with lots of air packages wrapped inside so don't worry of any damages. I got it by 'Gati"" courier service. The guitar have stunning looks, light weighted and those extra strings make you carefree.Its stunning, its fantastic, its amazing, its Amazon!! Love to shop from here :)A very big thank you :)",5
"Great value for money. As a musician, this product is really worth it for beginners, and also as a gift to musically-inclined children.Can't figure out how they can sell it so cheap...the negative reviews are probably from brick-and-mortar stores who are feeling threatened :-)I don't know if there's going to be any problems down the line after a few months, but as of now, this is a great deal indeed...",5
Bought one to gift my son. So far so good. tho strings aren't that durable. have to make a buy quite soon but no complains as overall product is doing just fine. looks wise it is worth it.,4
"The product is really awesome. People ask me how I got it for 2k. Though it toom them more than a week to deliver this, It came with a huge packing filled with bubble wrap. It comes with an extra set of strings, 2 picks, a carry bag and a strap. This is great for beginners.One thing people are complaining that it has only one slot for strap. I also thought so but than I saw a video of lumineers where the lead was carryinh the guitar wich hung from the neck with a thread. I checked the strap and I found a thread in the pack. U can also do that",5
"It's very good for beginners, I received it in good packing , you might have to calibrate it , the build quality is nice. Satisfied with the product worth for money",5
"Yes, I am very happy, product is good as per price, you have to tune guitar by tune guitar app. Otherwise got delivery on time. Packing is good. Good for beginners. Cover is nice. I can give rating 8.5/10 as per product.",4
This guitar is best for beginners .,5
Superb .... It's very amazing experience with the service of amazon and product .. thank you,4
Good but try to spend more money and go for rs.5000 price guitars,4
Best for beginners ! ....,4
Good in this price range,4
"Best product for this price. But only problem is last two strings are very very weak, which mean my guitar's last string had cutted down with in a month. But the spare string is little bit strong.",4
"It is good guitar for beginners, I have bought this year back and learned with ease only thing is that it is hard to press the notes initially but by time and experience you can definitely learn.One flaw Tuning pegs are bad.",4
It is a great product for the bigginners but keep in mind that it's frets are a lit more far away from the strings which could result in finger pain when using for long time and also it has only 18 frets.,3
Ok,4
Very good for beginners...it sound nice..but M little bit disappointed for packaging...u might do it better,4
I like it,4
Package is not fully packed properly. Tape is already removed when I recieved the order. Inside wrapper was also teared. Luckilly the product is not damaged.Product is good in this range(1690).Sound quality is also good.,4
Very affordable and good product.every thing is good but the dots on the frets are in wrong position.,4
Good Product,3
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Good for absolute beginners who doesn't know how to even hold a guitar. It's light weight & handy. Base is good.I recommend not to buy if you already have a guitar because it's for beginners only & if you have any guitar & know how to play then you won't like it that much.Overall it's good for initial stage.",5
"If you really want to learn Guitar or if you are looking for a career in Music, or if you have a hobby to play guitar or you want to start, I will recommend other better guitars with some wood not like hard cardboard like this. so you will not get good sound quality. Go for other better guitars in the market. Definitely no to this irrespective of its price",2
"The guitar is really good for beginners,  u cant expect much for the price .",4
It's just average product. But not justified the value. Sound quality is not good,3
"Awesome and attractive piece of guitar...Sound is very nice for this price point..Packaging was way too big for the product.. but i think its necessary to protect the delicate guitar...As we all have sports n music centers in our cities bt the initial price for a guitar starts from atleast 3000 bucks... Bt this product is way too far from that expensive pieces..Bought it at 1899/- in a sale at amazon, bt its worth under 2500/- go for it..You get all the accessories with it.. even a strap n good quality bag..So handy to play, must buy for beginnersOverall best experience, Hassel Free..Thank you seller & Amazon.....",5
At this price good one for beginner,4
"Good one for biginners ... Sound quality is also good. Value for money product n I received delivery on time n very fast, just in one day...",4
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Received a damaged Guitar",1
Sounds are not up to the standard,3
"I bought this for 1999/- to learn how to play guitar. The very first day when i start using/tuning this guitar, g string was broken and also there is a small dent on the guitar. A part from these two cons, I think this is a great deal at the price range.",4
Not a good quality at all product.,5
Product was damaged little .  Replacement request placed,4
After coming I not checked this product. I got it after 3 days it is already damaged??,4
Best for beginners,4
"This is for beginners only, built quality is poor, strings breaks even you are not using it !... Overall plays roll in your showcase only....",3
The guitar is lightweight and great to hold onto but the sound seems a little bit off but at this price it's the best you can get. For beginners!,4
"This guitar is beautiful, love the design, good for kids,but please don't expect much from 2k guitar, I tried playing many songs but it sound really different, if you are purchasing guitar for learning and playing songs, this is not for you, For music lover you should raise your budget to enjoy the real music, also its very tough hold strings in fretboard, you have press very hard and in some cases its impossible with this guitar. but at this price range and for show piece it good,",3
"I had left my fender in US and bought this while I was in India for 2 weeks. Thought a cheap one would be ok. Was wrong. Terrible sound quality and not easy to play. If you want to learn guitar, spend the money and get a better one. Trying to learn on this is going to be demotivating.",1
"It’s a good one. I am just a beginner and so asked my tutor to have a look... and he said it’s good.It’s light so if you wanna kam or take out for picnic... it just goes well. Its perfect. No flaws.Just if your re a professional and really feel like you wanna perform....may be go for Yamaha or something.  Else, it’s good. 7.5/10",5
It is really great product it has all stuff that was shown in picture . Guitar is too light with smoth and shiny body. Great product in this much less price........ 👌🌹👍👍,5
"For the price, I didn't expect a great guitar. However, I'd like to say a few things.1. Package came very well protected and undamaged.2. I was surprised to see the SIZE of the guitar, I'd say about half the size of a normal guitar (meaning it's more for a 7 to 10 years old}.I wish the seller was more direct to mention this. I definitely WON'T HAVE BOUGHT this if i knew the size was so small. I'll surely down vote the seller if possible.3. Guitar was undamaged4. Guitar came with a pair of cheap but usable plectrums, a set of steel strings, a synthetic material strap and a cheap looking plasticy carry bag.5. There is only one knob to sling the guitar strap (on the right side of the guitar) and the guitar strap is completely USELESS without being unable to be attached to 2 sides.6. Playing the guitar.... On such a small guitar, I expected toy like sound. However, they were playable and most keys were sort of acceptable. But since the strings were high, fingers hurts quickly.Also I noted that chords played closer to the body of the guitar tends to sound muffled and off tune.7. Finally, I am going to keep the guitar just in case my son (2 years 4 months now) may learn guitar when he grows up.To be honest, I am pissed that such an important fact was HIDDEN from buyers.As I said, I won't have bought this if I knew the size of this guitar",1
For beginner's ok,3
Honestly it's really good for beginners. Built quality is good. There is single strap for bag. No pick guard. No dots on the neck on top view. But still considering the price go fir it blindly. Packing was quite good. This wood will last for 3 4 years. By that time u can take yamaha or fender.,5
Good sound quality and light wt to carry,5
Good for beginners.,3
"This 38 inch Guitar with 18 frets has COPPER CLAD STEEL STRINGS and is ideal for Beginners and people who are not taller than 5ft 6 inches. For people above 5ft 8inches or so, this guitar might look like a toy in your hands. You people should therefore opt for a 40 inches guitar. The product was delivered to me on time with neatly packed and the items were present exactly as shown in the picture.",4
"Guitar is good but not send pick & bag, extra strings so please send me as early as possible otherwise I will return this product till 25 Jan 2020",4
Entry level basic acoustic guitar of good quality. Real value for money. Very good for beginners.,4
"It's for youngsters , sounds good & reliable,but not recommendable for adults .",4
Backside is a dent..like a tap of finger..But almost eberything is fyn..Happy with the product,4
It's A Decent Product With A Good Quality....One Thing Is That It's Body Colour I Mean That White Stripe On The Border Fades Away... Everything Else Is Nice🔥🔥,5
Awesome product it's sounds good but it was perfect for beginners i m happy with this product,4
Don't buy cheap guitars.,2
"Loving it! I'm beginner and just enjoying to learn this guitar. Guitar was delivered in nice packaging - so thanks for the seller and Amazon. It came with Bag, extra strings and a strap. Guitar was not tuned, but I tuned it with help of Garage Band on my Mac laptop. Its very easy, anyone can do it. Overall I'm very much satisfied with product.",4
Well don't know how much day will it last but honestly the sound quality is very good and even than any other local indian guitars.Pros:-small portable 38inch fretboard guitar-sound is rich and balanced-factory polish is good for instant play-affordable and a must try for SINGERS practicing with acoustic guitarsCons:- can't comment about the longevity-strings are a bit high for playing lead part- higher octave is not easily accessible-no truss rod adjustment,3
Good for beginners...but packaging was not so good...Amazon should take care of this,4
The guitar is nice!!Cons-CheapGood soundMade of sturdy materialIsn't very fragile(but care should be taken)Cons-The finishing off the product is not that good but doesn't make a difference and compromisable at this price.The bag is nice but here also the finishing ain't that great.Verdict-Great if ur low on budgetRecommend if low on budgetBut if I can go higher then there are better options!!,4
Buy and practice well. As per time you too will not be a beginner and you will notice many small differences which matters but till then use it.,5
"Once I bought a chinese guitar from a shop which looked awesome but had serious fabrication problem while resulted in bad sound and difficulty in playing. This one is exactly opposite. It doesn't look very exquisite but sounds proper. Also, I think it is worth only if you get it for around  2k. After that, better options are available.. But there is no problem as such..",4
"The built quality can be compromised, but the sound quility should be iproved! I am not satisfied with the clearity of viration and pitch that comes.!",4
It can be better but unless I'm loving it till now.,4
Guitar looks good but the quality is not that great... the fret boards looks so cheap and the picks broke within a day of normal usage.. The strings are not perfect the have some curves heare and there and also the are steel strings... Other than these quality issues guitar is good for beginers. The best thing to do is to replace the strings with more quality strings to get a better sound quality... overall this is good for this price range...,3
"Excellent for Beginners, sound quality is very nice.",5
Could have been more better. Sound quality is not as expected and also minute scratches on the guitar. Finishing not so good. Overall good product for beginners. But could have been more better,3
Not so good not so bad.. value fr money... Perfect fr beginner... Perfect for those people who are not want to spend too much money......,4
For this price range it is worth buying.,4
"Very good one for beginners, sound quality is OK,Packing was so good",4
"Good quality, sound quality is also good. For beginners its good choice. little scratchesr there like dot but not much packing is also good over all full paisa vasool...",3
A very nice products I like the guitar. Awesome.but the sound quality it little bit low. but it is perfect.,4
"Awsm product along with bag, extra string, chord to play.. Perfect for begginers.",4
"I bought this yesterday, no good sound, not good quality of string, not good quality of wood.. pleasee...guys, don't waste your money... Don't waste.. save money and buy YAMAHA only..",1
Nice for beginners,5
Best buy for price and best deal for beginners.,4
"Since it is for the beginners ,some more extra strings should have been provided.",4
"Hi guys,This guitar is not a bad guitarOnly if you feel like you wanna experiment with playing guitarBut I do not recommend it if you're extremely serious about taking up guitar.There are amazing guitar s if you increase your price range a bit (maybe 4000 rupees). Because this guitar only has 19 frets and is extremely hard to okay because of high action. The tuning legs are of low quality and sound quality is average at bestPlease think about buying guitar s from bands like kaps, kadence or even Yamaha (the f310 is an amazing choice for everyone)Hope I was helpful.",2
Perfect for beginners.. Sound quality is good.. And it looks very attractive.. 😍,4
Good product for beginners to enhance their skills.,4
"I highly recommend this guitar to begginers if you can't afford too much money . Guitar's build quality was good , but didn't like the way they had painted the body of it.Strings ( which came along with the guitar ) was just good at work but didn't have much warmth and brightness in tone . Still a better deal under 2k .",4
It’s worth to buy I am little hesitant to buy but letter on all the dought get cleared rather then buying from any shops,4
Thank you..!!,5
product was good but damaged in b/w shipping. worest packing,3
THIS PRODUCT IS FOR ONLY SHOW OFFACTION TOO HIGHBUILD QUALITY JUST OKYOU CAN PLAY SINGLE STRING VERY WELLDOTS ARE NOT CORRECTYOU CAN'T PLACE YOUR FINGER TO PLAY CHORDS,4
the whole guitar is not made of wood it is made of plastic with the 4 to 5 month it get bend and it is not repair further sound quality is ok,3
"This guitar is good for beginners.But it is not lasting and the sound quality is very low.So, overall a good product for beginners only.Easy to handle.",3
Very nice product.. thanks to amazon bringing  me the product safe.. sound  quality is very good.. in single line  I can say  it very good for beginners😍😍,4
Good for beginners,3
These guiter is good for lil kid not for teenager..becoz size of these guiter very small and weight is also low....,3
Awesome guitarI love itIt is a very good one in very cheap price ypu can buy this guitar without any second thoughtEasy to handlePerfect for beginners,5
Awesome product at this price range....writing reviews after 3 days of usage. No problem till now.,4
This is for amateur guitar enthusiasts. You can determine whether you want to invest more in a guitar if you actually like playing a guitar.,3
Sound is not so much good as other guitars..a person who knows nothing about guitar then it is good for them in low price.,3
Packaging is pretty good and for beginners it is perfect 👍🏻,4
It's my 2nd guitar. It's good for those who want to learn play guitar,4
"Product is worth the price, but little disappointed about the finishing of colour. Else product is very excellent!",4
"It was an unexpected gift to my son who just finished his 12 th, he really fell in love with it. It has a nice cover bag . The packaging was very good. Thank you Amazon for quality check",5
It's fine for beginners. But some manual instructions will be better for users inside packing,4
"Delivery was good. packing was good. Product is same as mentioned.If you are a beginner and if you wish to buy budget friendly guitar, then this is it. All items are provided as mentioned. I am 5' 2'' and it fits in my arms. Sound quality is okay, not best as Yamaha guitar would sound. Overall, for this price, it is good.",4
"The delivery service was dissatisfying, because the shipping company just uploaded that my address was unlocatable, since the package was very large they updated a fake reason. But leaving this, the packaging and the guitar was fantastic. I got all the accessories that were shown and the guitar was also very same to the one shown in the pic. The build quality is very good and the size of guitar is just suitable for a 16 year guy like me. Also the voice is very good. So... The guitar fits it's price and I liked it !!",5
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The space between strings and fretboard is too much, Hence it will start making a buzzing sound within days, I got it yesterday and today it's making buzzing sound 🤦‍♀️ also due to too much space you'll need to press the strings way too hard which will hurt your fingers plus it makes playing guitar difficult. Action of guitar is not good. Truss road is not adjustable. Would not recommend this at all. Specially to beginners.It's cheap and looks good. Packaging and delivery service were also good. You can prolly buy it for photoshoot or as a showpiece though.  Don't buy it for playing or learning guitar.",1
"Simple and neat , quality is good",4
Very good guitar at this priceReally nice,4
Good for beginners sound quality is good too,4
Good product 🥰,4
"I purchased this two weeks back and it broke the string while I was tuning it. This would be my third guitar purchase but this one for my cousin to learn as a beginner and while it has not bad of a sound, It does feel pretty flimsy. It broke the E string on very first tuning. They do give extra set of strings but of course. Frets are subtle for beginners not to get their fingers busted by strings. Other than that, I don't see my cousin moving around a lot with it as carelessly as one should with their instrument. Feels like made of very thin wood.",2
"For the price the product is good, However the quality of the strings  is the pain point. Though they provide extra strings but they are very delicate.",3
Product view is too good,4
Just Awsm for beginners...Awsm finishing..love it ♥️✨,4
"Guitar packing not good , and its bag chain broken ,also some sractes and small breakes in body of guitar,not satisfied with ur product ...🙄😒 Only sound is ok for me",2
It is a good buy for the beginners. A bit on the light side and also the strings are to close to the neck. The sound made has a hint of an uneven noise. But overall if you wanna start learning to play it's one of the bet options out der.,4
Good product for biginners,4
Dope cheez gmh,4
Sound quality is very good,4
12 days I was waiting for this guitar but I got damaged one....packaging was also not good...,3
Nice products 😊,4
Neck Bend After 2 Weeks,1
this is a guitar which has a great quality but its for begginers....,4
It doesn't have trust rodAnd it is hard to while playing the chords,1
"Good for beginners, 12 frets up to body is a slight drawback. But good to test yourself, if you have that dedication n passion to continue practicing and then go for the costly ones",4
I love this gitar it's so looks good this is my 1 guitar I like it soooo m and the product quality is soo m good cnat aaacepted also,4
Ordered for someone special. Guy liked it.,4
"Strings are all arranged very bad , not working properly . I wish I could return the product but it’s already late",1
Cheap but worst,1
Awsome budget guitar to learn,4
Worth buying... totally loved it,4
Very nice guitar specially for beginners.. Sound quality is alsoo good... But if you r beginner.. You will have.. To practice soo many times nd it will hurt your fingers soo much specially 3 fingers.. But.. It is good.. 😇😇you can buy it definitely 😇😇😇,5
"Perfect for beginners, if you're in intermediate level, spend some more money and get brand like Yamaha, valut etc. Which will definitely motivate you to play guitar",4
Best guitar to get started with. This is a bit small in size which is good for beginners as they can handle it better. Easy to play and sounds pleasing.Once you are good enough to play without looking at fretboard then good for better and bigger one.Made in china. Imported quality. Presentation is 5 star. You wont be disappointed.,5
I am a beginner just got to give a try. quality is okay for the money spent. String got broken while tuning. Overall I am satisfied for the price,4
Not great for professional but quite good for beginners....,4
Nicely packed and received with no scratches on it. If you're a beginner and looking for a guitar with affordable price and good quality? this is the one..it looks good and have a good sound quality and overall value for money..you'll never regret after buying this guitar.,5
"With this money, it's nice",4
"pros:* The guitar has fair sound for its price.* Looks goodCon:* Action is too high, double of what is expectedAction is the distance between the frets and the strings or how high the strings are. If this is too high you would have to press very hard to get a good sound and this will hurt your fingers.Action measured at 12th fret was 0.5mm should be about 0.28mm, ill attach an imageYou might have heard playing guitars usually hurts the fingers but with this it hurts more than it should.As beginner this experience might deter you from learning guitar or practicing more.Learning guitars could be difficult but it shouldn't be a pain.If you are beginner buy guitar from trusted brand accompanied by someone experienced.",1
It's completely a beginner's guitar... It's have a superb look.... It's suitable for all age... The difference between the frets and the string is greater than others guitars... That's why this strings little hurts during playing the guitar,4
Quality,2
"The best for whom they feel like having a guitar and learning it by himself from the YouTube Classes. Worth for the Price, I loved It to have though it was my First One and i am a person like mentioned Above. And i am learning it smoothly in this. Go For IT who think in the same way. Its good for Photos too.",4

 good for beginners.... i like it very much",5
"For beginners its most recommended product,  sound quality you have to compromise because of price not muchbad its good. Comfortably is ok not an issue, quality of strings are not much bad ok. But bcareful while tuning.",3
Sound quality is good... for beginners this would be a good one.,4
Beautiful product. Packing and all is perfect. The guitar is great. Contains all the things mentioned in the package. The colour and look is so damn cool. Happy to buy this and that too at such an affordable rate.,5
"Packing was not that good. I didn't received the guitar in a hugh box it was in it's own box, which was disappointing. Quality of the sound is fair. Looks great. But the only problem with this guitar is that it's nearly impossible to tune E string, when you tune it ,it breaks. You have to spend 200₹ to buy good strings from the shop.OVERALL it's fair. Can't complain much , it's cheap.",3
"Sound ossum.💕😍😍,  Im happy 😁😃😃Packing also Good. Tq Amazon 😄😄🤗",4
It's nice for beginner,4
Tone not up to the markGuitar strings are not perfectly aligned!But quality ok okAnd its nice in the range 2-2.5K,3

 I like it.really good but packaging is not very well but that good.",4
"this is above average quality guitar for beginners. Good to start with but once you are comfortable in learning how to use guitar, you may want to go for better quality guitar with much better acoustics and quality.",3
Decent nice product,4
"This is something great for the beginners, looks cool, lightweight, sound quality is fine.",4
"Packing was good , Guitar is good but looks little small,but Pick And Strap are kept inside the bag.. I thought it's not there for first two days.. then found in inside the Bag zip.",4

 Fretboard is not that good,,  but awesome guitar. Just pick it and fall in love with the sound",4
I m happy to have this product 😊 osm for beginners,4
Good sound. Good feel of playing. the strings are not exactly very good but can't expect much at the price. Overall satisfied,4
Good worth for money,4
Good for beginners and low cost also allover good product 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂,4
It is good for biggeners and its sound quality is also goodI got my guitar fully packed in a box.,3
"Do not buy this product, even if you're an absolute beginner!I received this guitar yesterday and immediately learnt that the guitar action is too high. For those who don't know what guitar action is: it is the distance between a string and the fretboard of the guitar. While guitars are meant to have 0.2-0.25 mm of action ideally, the one I received had it as 0.5mm, making it unplayable. As a beginner you may not notice this right away, but playing anything on this guitar will be impossible for you and you'll wonder if something is wrong with you.I have ordered a replacement from Amazon, will update my review based on the replacement guitar.PS: you cannot adjust this without taking it to a shop, which will cost you a lot. It's better to just add a bit to your budget and get a better, playable guitar at 6-7k.",1
"product is as same as shown in the picture. A really cheap and nice guitar in the price range, especially for the begginers. However after playing the guitar for some time, it usually goes a lil' bit out of tune. Otherwise the product is really working well till now. The packaging was great too.",4
"This is actually my fifth time to buy this Juarez acoustic guitar! And I am satisfied with all the products, the package was good and it was properly maintained! The sound of the guitar is also good. If you wanna buy for beginner , this is recommended!",4
"The sound quality is good. It's easy to learn with a small size guitar, but won't recommend to beginners.I received the guitar with no bubble wrap and it could have been easily damaged and the picks and extra strings were missing too. That's not good.Must check the product and all accessories while packing.",2
This is guitar is ok for the users who are planning to learn guitar. For this price range its ok. But the quality of this guitar is not that good. This guitar started sounding wierd after the use of 2 months.I don’t recommend this for beginners.,4
"This guitar has awesome and i am won the contest in my college, the guitar has won my contest. Iam loving it, my mother has gifted meThank you mom",4
Actually better than expected. Best for this price. Loved it,4
I'm reviewing this after 2 years.If you don't know how to play guitar you may like this at first impression.I thought I'll learn playing this then later buy a good one but this was worse decision.After playing for 3-4 months action got high and can't be correct because there is no truss rod.I recommend you do not ever buy any guitar without truss rod and also buy a decent guitar even for learning.It's not matter you are beginner or master everyone should have good gear.True thing is that have started playing with this guitar only so faced too much difficulty I wish you don't need to face the same.I'm Engineer and you know every engineer have a dream to play guitar 😁I recommend you to buyCort ad810Cort af510Yamaha f310/f280 (both is same)These all are under 10K,1
Nice Product in this budget,4
Would definitely suggest for beginners,4
"It is Good product but not as per your expectations, Sound quality is Avarage, Looking Good. If you're purely beginner then okey",3
Best guitar for beginner,4
Value for money. Best option for beginners at this price range,4
I got this pretty thing delivered yesterday and it's so good. Since I'm a beginner and I'm very petite I find this guitar easy to handle because it doesn't weigh too much and is not too big. I highly recommend this guitar to those who want to avoid a painful shoulder or arm. It is a good pick for kids also.,4
Wonderful product ..,4
"Only for begginers, sound quality is good...guitar is small in size ,assesorries are of poor quality...Recommended to use some other string for guitar such as ziko....",4
Like this product,3
sound quality is very clear and median equal That's what it should be.,5
I am very happy and this product came very carefully and very good I love it 😍❤️✨🥀🥀 thank you Amazon 🙏🏻,5
Pretty nice product for this price. Looks good with a nice black glossy finish but is prone to scratches. After tuning it does sound good but still not as good as a Fender or a Yamaha. Feels a bit delicate and not sure that is a good thing for an entry level product. Overall good buy and definitely value for money.,4
"This guitar is awesome. Price of this guitar is affordable for normal peoples. And it sound like premium guitar. Also the quality of guitar is better. For Lerners this guitar is best for learning. It is easy to carry. The quality of bag is also good.the finishing of guitar is quite low. But it sound awesome , look doesn't matter.",4
"Bought it on may and it is working fine till now. The picks were broke on the 2nd day. The sounds quality sucks and it does not sounds like an actual guitar, but it is cheap and may be a better option if you just want to learn.",4
Poor material used,2
I bought this guitar two weeks before and the lower e ( first string ) got cut off. I'm a beginner and hence not used much. Disappointed!,2
It's more than enough for a beigner,4
Awesome for beginners.. Sound quality is good as it's price. I like it👍🏻👍🏻,4
"This is perfect guitar for beginners its sounds really good i m not  facing any kind of  issues as mention in other comments but pick is not good while playing guitar it broke easly but over all this  product is very good at price of 2000 u get extra set of strings ,bag ,starp and cover.😍😍",4
"If you are a beginner and looking for a guitar, then go for it.Nice design, Nice color, Nice packing. And most importantly, nice sound.The quality is nice. Perfect weight.I am happy with this.Nice product.",5
"Action is too high as opposed to what has been described. Too thick strings that are difficult to play towards higher frets.  But it puts out huge sound/sustain. Overall , not a good value for money as promised (1500 vs 6000).Suggestions:Check the action/playability before despatch. It would up the value of your guitar.",3
Good product...,5
The last string (the thin one) has broke immediately on the day one I don’t know what went wrong but we could replace the same with spare strings providedBut bit worried if this breaks what to do,3
Good one for beginner. awesome sound,4
Much satisfied than expected,4
This is really good for beginners,4
nice,4
"If are a bignner and want to practice and learn to play guitar and if you have a budget lower than 2000 rupees, this could be a perfect choice. It's obviously not the best but for a beginner, I think this is just perfect. Thanks.",4
I really like this guitar,5
The product is very helpful for the beginners and  in this cheap price it is very good product in this price point.,4
For beginners its ok ok,3
Good products 👌👌👌,4
Ok... so i got this product few weeks ago and one of the string just came out..like it couldn't even last 2 weeks...it's just not worth buying,1
Nice product. Good for beginners.,4

 If you are a beginner then this guitar is very good for you 👍",5
Great product for beginners at this cost,4
Sound quality is awesome.. But action is high.. And the size is a little small,3
Awesome,5
"Decent guitar, but if you are ambitious about playing a guitar, then you might want to save a bit more money and move on to other brands.Some of the major setbacks that I've found in it are:1. ACTION IS WAY TO HIGH. AND ITS DETRIMENTAL FOR YOUR FINGERTIPS.2. Has only 18 frets, so many of the popular guitar solos can't be played.3. Sound is decent but not what a good guitarist would appreciate!",3
Good one 👍,4
Its a good guitar but i suggest u not to buy if have more money because lifr time investment is good,3
worth for money,4
"The best guitar one can get at this price, tune it good and it will amaze you with it's Nice and clear production of each and every Notes like a professional set.  Anyone who new to guitar/ wish to have a nice handy side pair should buy this.It comes well packed in a Big box with nice ""New thing"" frangrance. And inside there's two 0.49 mm pick set, Extra guitar strings, shoulder strap, And a brand print logo on a black cover.",5
Go for it,4
Very nice for beginners..,4

"I have only one problem with this guitar, which is, after playing it for sometime, the string gets loose and i have to tune it frequently. Other than that, everything is good considering the price (Rs.2000).",4
Good for starting suitable upto age 7-9,4
Guitar sounds good!Finishing Ok Ok!We can't really complain at this price!Not the best looking guitar!The black coating is Good but attracts a lot of finger touches!Guitar have extra set of strings which was great!  And it also comes with 3 picks!But bag is really low quality and looks super cheap!I am ashamed to carry guitar outdoor in that guitar bag!It would have been awsome if it came with a guitar  CAP!,3
Colour or finishing is good but distance of frate board and string is large as compared to other guitar so it is nice for beginners,4
I bought this product it's sound good and it is cheap and best for beginners. First time buying guitar felt happy with this product.,4

"I bought this 2 months back. I am new learner of Guiter. Already started playing few songs with some open chords.Pros: Light weight, Low price, Good Build Quality, Easy to play, Sound from Guiter Very Good, Good for Beginner's as like me.Cons: Guiter may bend after few months for that reason it will be difficult to play Fingering on higher fret.Overall Good, It is good for Beginner's.",5

"This is a great product, while it is for beginners, it's a very good value for money purchase - accessories include a spare set of strings, picks and a bag.",5
Ever since I started using mobile for two to three weeks I have never felt so bad for this product,3

"Product good. But giving 4 star cause courier was bad, delivery boy was not helpfull and did refuse to come my home to give the product, i had to go 2 km distance from my home to pick up the product from the delivery boy where he was hanging out with his friends",4

Very cheap quality don't buy it..Don't waste your money on this guitar buy some other guitar and guitar was damaged too,1
Over all good product sound quality also good,4
this is a good thing that one can have a guitar at this price but please don't buy if you are at learning stage as the space between the fret and strings is too high which is not a good thing. This is ok for casual play or to just to show off,3
"Sound quality good ,guitar are damaged in side the packaging, delivery will be not good,But i will manage.....",4
Nice one,4
This guitar is only for beginnersPlease dont but just because it is affordableIt does not have sound qualityNor the strings given are in good lengthThe 1st String broke at B3 where It should be tuned E4the tuning pegs are the worst of allFinishing is not goodThe only thing is good is the priceThose who have to practice chords position may only buy this guitar please,2

 I don't like this I'm money is weast don't buy this",1
For beginners this guitar is gud.,4
"I'm a beginner and I thought I would not need high priced guitars for just practising beginner lessons and other basic stuff. When I got the guitar, I was surprised. The guitar had a good tone. I learnt a lot of basic stuff with this guitar. But the strings are low quality and the action is very high (the advertisement is false - almost 6mm at 12th fret and 3mm at first fret). You'll hurt your fingers if you play for more than an hour and you can't barre the strings completely because of high action. Even the fret heights are uneven. So, my advice is that you go for branded guitars like Yamaha(you'll get a good budget acoustic guitar around 8k). Please don't buy this one. You can't make any good progress with this crap.",2
"Amazing guitar for beginners, very nice ,light weighted, beautiful guitar for hands on practice. I decided to buy this till I learn.",5
"Product received in good state, I bought it for my son who has just begun his guitar classes, he liked the product. Overall happy with the purchase.",4
"Good for beginner, good packaging, amazon delivery was best",4
Just got the quitar.. it's good but two strings are very delicate..while playing those strings are touching the base...good for beginners..not highly recommend.. sound quality is ok..,3
I don't like it,5

 Very nice, fabulous and best product at this price range this is the best guitar I have ever. Please don't go on other review. This is the on of the best product.",5
Value for money,4
Very good for beginners.,4
Quality is ok ok,4
Good for beginners..,4
Well the product is a good cheap alternative. The distance between the strings and the frets is a bit much but overall good.Can be used as a good showpiece too..,5
so excited to learn.  Been dreaming for long to play but there is a bit damage on sides. Thank amazon,4
action is too high.,3
"gap between bord and string in soo much ,,, so i will not recommend for biggners",3
Size is small. Is it possible to return the item and purchase a full size guitar?,3
Cost effective and affordable for beginners,4
I like the color . finishing is good. for beginners its a good start,4
"I've played a handful of guitars before. This is the worst I've ever touched with my hand.!It's no good even for beginners. The fretboard is so small so that you won't be able to play any chord without annoyed by the fingers touching other strings. The action is extremely high which will result in not just pain, 'injuries' in your fingertips.And the main problem I faced - the low e string is placed out of the fretboard so it cannot be played at all. Refer the picture.The sound quality is fine and comes in a cheap packaging. But considering the quality of the product inside - that's fine.If you are looking for a toy or decoration for your home, you can choose this.If you want to learn or play a guitar, spend a little more money and get a better one",1
Strings are not good,1
This is best for beginners👍👍,4
Strings or too far from board.. It's very hard to press the string on the fret.Apart from that I think good product with low cost,3
"Small, bad quality, sound is worst",2
Guitar pick and strings not given as mentioned in the Display picture on Amazon.,3
Good but for only beginner and children.Sound quality is good for price.,4
It was so eassy to get it has fluent sound,5
Product is very attractive sound quality is ok. But delivery time was very long. Literally frustrated with delivery time.,4
"Overall guitar is very good and his voice are so good and I am very happy to hear this voice... But the bag or belt are not good ... But main thing is guitar its very nice and his finessing is amazing.... So bigneer is take this AND ENJOY.........,😎😎😎😎😄😇😇😇",4
For beginners,4
I bought it only for Rs 1990 at the amazon grt indian sale according to my openion it is best in this price the steel strings of the guitar are good and its voice is also awesome its good for a starter. The thing which dissapoints me is the bag thats all.,4
Good quality product for beginners,4
"Sound quality is ok , packings is excellent, but finishing work is bad wood quality is very poor",3
Its look is nice. Good for beginners.,4
Guitar is very good for beginners to learn. It's light weighted. Cost is very reasonable. Looks good. Quality of the product is good.Packaging is also very well done. Very satisfied with the purchase :),5
"Just delivered juarez guitar..product was good at this price range..I got guitar, bag, strap, and extra strings with in the box. I didn't get picks for playing the guitar. Thats very disappointed.",3
Highly recommended for beginners,4
"Guitar 🎸 is Just amazing at this price and also looking classy, but I've received a Damaged Guitar, Packing of this product must be improve alot, its damaged bcz of cheap packing..",5
Very good product,4
I brought this Guitar for my younger son. Quality and performance is excellent build quality 5star sound quality 5star delivery on time 5star. Thanks Amazon,5
I have been using this guitar for a month now and it’s going good. Sound is okish and quality is not so bad either when you look at how inexpensive this is. I am a beginner so didn’t want to spend much on a guitar at this stage so bought it based on the reviews. Overall a good quality inexpensive guitar.,5
Sound quality is terrible,1
Nice product good sound nice product,4
Its My First Guitar... Firstly I searched 100 of guitar ... But it was out of budget..then I found this ... I thought it is very cheap so it must be a frod ... But when it arrived my home I was totally shocked... It was looking a 10000 ra guitar... What a polish and finishing... Its a very great product... And sound is too amazing... I'm not able to post sound... Nhi toh sunata tha sbko ....bahot mast hain ...paisa wasool,5
Worth buying. Cheap and best,5
Budget Friendly,4
it's good for beginner Worth it,4
"This is one of the first product which I buyed on Amazon and have to agree that they provide excellent customer service as well as packing and ALL that stuff is excellent , talking abt the GUITAR IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if ur beginner its play smooth and all cord are executed prefectly , the sound quality is also high as compared to the price which they are giving it",5
Very good,4
The guitar is best if you are a newbie and are just fiddling with the idea of guitarAs it's very inexpensive you can get it in 1600 to 2000  which it is worth it,4
Good one for beginners ..,4
"Awesome I'm loving it. Quality wise good. I'm beginner and feel that strings are strong. It's been almost a month now. I believe Beginners can go ahead with this product, got it less than 1.5k",4
"As primary observation, I feel fantastic instrument in such cost. I like it. Detailed reviews and feedback will update soon",4
I wouldn't recommend buying this even if you are a beginner. It takes a lot time to tune the guitar. My first set of string which came with the guitar are wasted already. Build quality is poor. Save more and invest in something better than this.,2
"I love the way i came packed and it is a good guitar for budget segment and best ever guitar for beginners if you are looking for a best,budget and a good guitar then consider this one ...",5
First 3 string have different sound ...other strings like 4 5 and 6 is just right ....guitar quality is good . Good for beginners only not for professional. But sound quality is good.,2
"Only for childrens who are learning guitars , best for beginners as an their first guitar",3
"The guitar is good. At first, the tune is out of range. It is quite challenging for beginners but you can set it up through some apps.",5
"First of all packing of product is amazing, comes inside a huge box likewise 50"" tv box packing. 200% given to Amazon for packingGuitar comes with all accessories mentioned as described. It's little bit small in size in compare to regular guitar, but sound clarity and bass is good. Its the best guitar for beginners. It's a worth buy under 2k in lightning deal offer . I recommend it for taking it blindly. Don't think twice before buying it . Just do it",5
It's colour was so nice as similar to the picture also packing was niceAnd sound quality was awesome,5
"the strings are way too high, when you press it your fingers will hurt and its very hard to play as you have to press so much and its much different than other guitar where you just pretty much have to touch on the frets. But also my cousin had another guitar of the same brand and it was pretty fine, it was also of the same price but a blue colored one.",1
Pick was not there,4
This is the great guitar for the beginners to learn . and it is very affordable . and sound quality is also good . great guitar for learning .,5
Well nice product and value for money.if you are beginner go for it.,4
Good for beginners.Sound is better than other guitars in this price segment.Build quality is up to the mark.,4
string are not good....my extra string is also broken when i replace it with other one.... quality is good nd the price is in budget for beginners ...♥️,4
Good holding of the strings. ...decent sound. ..but not the first two strings and thats pathetic while tuning...other than that everything's fine. ...and by the way it is small for long hands. ..,4
"Amazing service by amazon..product replaced in a day..Reg product, its food for beginners and need to handled with care due to missing steel rod support in handle and strings..overall a good buy for beginners...",4
Quality is good and my son liked it a lot. Even though the delivery status was updated but It was delivered one day in advance,5
"This is a good guitar. Definitely recommend for beginners! One thing u have to do is be careful with the first and third string (e,d). They are a little loose. 🙂 Overall an awesome guitar. The colour is great, those pricks are way too ting but manageable. Otherwise had a good experience.",4
Good for beginners because of cheap rate. Not very good sound but ok.,3
For beginners... Juarez 🎸... S very good... Pls go for it... I loved it...😍🤩😁🥰,4
So basically I'm a beginner in learning guitar. This guitar is absolutely the best choice if you're freshly starting to learn how to play it. I've got it all good.,3
Best for beginners. Only problem i faced is paint comes of very easily..,5
Perfect Guitar for Beginners. Sound Quality is Great. Build Quality is Decent,4
Its comfortable although it is easy to play,5
"I did not think it would be so good, there is a very good product inside 2000, I really liked it and delivered it to Amazon Safe Home ..",5
awesome product.. it is china product. it sound too much melodious. it is good for beginner to learn guitar..one basic problem is that the neck of this guitar can be banded easily but repair of its is not easy enough..but someone want to buy a guitar for learning. it is awesome,4
"When you see first time, it's looking good bt when you play this, it's horrible. When i see and play this from YouTube, it's very different. You can't tuning right. 12 fred has not 2 marking also side. Add more 2K-3k and buy good guitar.",2
"For beginners or for professionals this guitar is useless I bought it nd when I played for 10 days the ""Bridge"" got broke nd sound quality is the worst even one star is too much for this guitar only useful to showcase on the wall not for playing..I regret buying this pls don't buy any guitar without professional suggestions I recommend you to buy 5k guitar with truss rod",1
"I have received the product but no warranty card inside the box..... And unless that issue the product is okay......Cons:More actionFingers are paining while playingSo hard strings for beginnersPros:Best for the priceGood accessories like bag, extra strings and picks etc",4
Overall good if you are planning to learn guitar.,4
"Performance ,sound not at all good. Even beginners should not buy. Strings alignment not correct. Strings are fragile. Not worth for even RS.2000.00",1
I hoped it would be bigger but small in size.,3
You get what you pay for. It's worth it's price. Practice guitar for me and my kids!,4
Value for money.But not suitable for beginners as string distance is more between board so hurts fingers,4
The assembling of the strings is not perfect. They are required to be pressed with thrice force in comparison to the normal guitar.,5
It is amazing! Really good for beginners!,5
It very good considering the price.. Buy this without regret if you're buying this to learn..,4
Good guitar for beginners,4
Sound was echoing at first you must adjust it with someone's help but it is amazing,4
The action length is very high. My fingers hurt.,3
You may not use it for long.,3
"Beautiful piece.......... Light weight. I thought it will be of a tough and heavy wood, but it's not of the best quality. Ok ok.....type of wood had been used. Sound is pretty good👍.",4
Well . If you are a professional u will probably not prefer this guitar .As the guitar stays in the fulfillment center for long with time the neck gets bentAnd there is no Trust Rod in the Guitar to adjust it .If you are a beginner who knows nothing about guitarAnd just want to learn it and isn't looking for a guitar for a long time purpose u can go ahead and purchase it .,2
"It is quite light and easy to play for beginners but the strings are too fragile and might break easily. Guitarists who've been playing for years this might not be an ideal choice,for beginners it's okay as slides are a lot easier in this.",3
Best product,5
"Good for beginners. However sound quality is not so good, but good at this price",4
Best guitar for beginners...I think I can learn best with this one. My first experience to purchase a guitar was very hesitant but now after using it for around 3 weeks I'm very very satisfied.,5
Very nice product for beginners thank you Amazon.,5
"The guitar is good for beginners, no bag and picks where delivered with the guitar.",4
It's very good for beginners..... I m highly recommend it if u r a learner...,4
This guitar is good for beginners and the quality of packaging was excellent. The delivery was well on time..overall the product quality i will rate as 5 as of a beginner..and worth the penny too,5
"Wires , pick and strap also mentioned eith this guitar but i didn't get it ...i only got giutar and cover thats it. Why it is mentioned in description",3
Amazing,4
"Guitar received with missing parts- no pics/strings were received and bridge gap is significant, humming sound is too high with becomes unstable and sounds bad. Some strings are too tight to begin with, not preferred for beginners either.",2
Guitar is actually good sounds good and worth itFor this money rangeJust open the package in front off the delivery guys incase off any damage occurs,5
If you are purchasing your first guitar 🎸I suggest you that Just go for it,3
• Not for beginners strings to high• Quality is good• Value for money,4
"I had bought this guitar today in a sale i got it in a sale at 1990/-. It is a wonderful guitar .Its sound is very amazing. well polished. But The strap is not strong.also u cannot connect it to speaker's. But no need of speakers as its sound is very awesome. In short guitar is just amazing at this price.  If u are confused between jixing,intern and juârez, i would suggest u to go for Juârez.",5
Nice  guitar for  beginners.... It's tunner is  plastic based and low  quality of  strings but  over all  nice  beginning guitar.,3
Nice product for a pure beginner. It is somewhat short for me but it's fine. It sounds really great. But the guitar seems a little bit weak...But all I am getting it for a mere Rs 2000 only..Really nice product at this price...,4
i strongly recommended for bigginers and also used for experienced people.....very better,4
Bought at rs 2175 . Recieved the product within given time period.quality of the guitar is very nice . Recieved in a very good condition with nicely packed and timely delivered. Happy with the product .,5
"A good buy for beginners, but had to return one piece due to bad finishing on the guitar body.",5
Good,3
Good product for beginners,4
"Good option for beginners. Weight is very low, easy tho carry.",3
Its good for beginners..... Worthy ... Sound quality is bad..... Material strength is also bad,4
Very good product,5
"I started with this, my trainer told me it’s pretty decent guitar for beginners. I you not sure you will learn or just make it showpiece better not to buy expansive one. Start with this and if you really interested then go to next level.",5
Total 18 frates are there usually it's should be like 21 frates !!,2
Strings are closer to each other neck is broken fret board is separateing before u buy 😊,5
Value for Money. Got the Guitar in such a huge/big box that my Neighbor thought that i ordered 100 inch TV or something. The product description is totally accurate and i received all the accessories mentioned with the product. The Guitar is a great buy for someone like me who is new to guitar experience and want to learn the guitar but is also cautious to spend huge bucks on big branded guitars. The Sound Quality is also good and overall its a Steal Deal!!!!,5
Well the product is good ...but the delivery was too late ....,3
Nice product in valuable. But gutier bag is not perfect.,4
Okay okay,3
Good for kids,3
Strings are little more highted from frateboard than the highly cost guitar....,3
Okay for beginners,4
"After tuning its awesome ,good packing must buy",5
I just bought this  3 days ago and loving it so far since it's my first guitar. It's not that good but it's not bad either. The E high string broke after 3 days. They gave me some extra strings so it's fine ig.,3
Not great,2
Strings gap is more then 5mm but is very useful for beginners I suggest this for beginners,5
"Okay for beginners, Not smooth.",3
Average product according to price.They send blue colour. But looks ok..,3
"Action (distance between string and fret board) is way too highAction is even greater than the distance between two strings.There is no truss rod so you can't change the action.I had to sand down the string rests on both end but still action is way too high.Not at all for beginners as the strings are way too hard to press down, and beginner would think that is how hard guitar is. pressing down any string with pinky finger is next to impossible.",1
I am a beginner. I don't know much about guitar. I found somewhere that it is good guitar and purchased it.,5
Good on this price,3
Superbly designed for beginners.Affordable and easy to handle.Sound is soothing.,5
"Ordered black colored Guitar but received yellow one, I guess they're trying to fulfill order it from their existing stock. Have not returned it just because it is not bad, and quality of components is also good. Sound is very pleasant and for beginner it is good.",2
The buzz sound kills the mood.,3
"It's pretty good for practice. But, the string design makes it difficult to change strings and don't look like they'll last. Also, it's fully acoustic so drawbacks over there.",4
Nice...,4
Cheap but not worth it.,1
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Cover, strap, extra wire. Tuner and perfect at the rates. This is a review after 2 years. No breakage in wood or wire. Very popular in social media, hobbyists, and learning students",5
Cgjkhgfgii,3
Excelleent packing.. average sound quality.. strings quality is poor .,3
Not bad for price range but the gap between strings and fret board is too much.. hence too hard to play chords..,4
"For biggners it is good .... Sound is also good .. lookwise it's nice as shown in picture .. but one thing that is very bad is it's frets , i didn't find them good .. it's frets are very stemp on ..",3
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I love this guitar super colour no damage sound quality super low buget  super  guitar",5
"Good for beginners, sound quality is decent and in par with the price. Got the product a day prior to the expected delivery date.",4
Little damaged.Good for beginners.Sound quality is good.Few places colour rubbed,3
It's worth for price very good sound... Awesome instrument for beginners...... Same as shown in pic.. Not expectation 🎸 reality 🎸 like that and all ...good product,3
Amazing product and perfect choice for beginners... So if you're looking for a guitar and if you're beginner.. just go for it man it's great for you..  To be honest I'm fully satisfied with this product and specially it's packing is really appreciable...  Thank you Amazon..,4
"Packaging was ripped. It was so poor, I couldn’t believe that it was from amazon. Rest the guitar was fine but first impression is last impression. I was really disappointed by the packaging. Looked like someone opened it before me and placed it back. Unbelievable",2
It's an ideal piece for the beginners.,4
"Special Note : The guitar is of small size i.e 38' And not a full sized guitar.REVIEW:I bought this by mistake assuming it as full sized, but still the guitar is superb, light weight easy to take anywhere, plays loud and sound quality is good. A best you can get at Rs.2500/-",4
"This is very good guitar in this range.It is just for beginners to learn guitar.I bought for Rs.1999 in amazon offer.No issue about any damage.Guitar was packed in box included cover bag,extra strings,one belt and 3 Picks.So anyone want to buy for just learning,this would be best in this price range.",4
😊,4
For price.. It's good.,3
Good for beginners....,5
I liked the guitar as i was a beginner and it completely suits me its size was perfect for me and the sound was also so clean the body doesn't have any scratch on it and came with good packing,5
I am also new to learn guitar so I will suggest to purches this guitar for beginners its very easy to learn,5
"Am a professional guitarist bought dis guitar for practicing for my sister.... gud product as for the price I got it at Ra 1990 . Sounds steel guitar , not much bass sound, suitable for girls and short people absolute right guitar for beginners... I would blindly recommend it",4
It's a fantastic product and I thoroughly loved it. I am a beginner and I am quite happy with the performance. Even my teacher said the same and told it's got way better sound than the normal beginners' guitars. I am very happy with the packaging of Amazon and it's super quick delivery. Thanks a lot.,4
Best for beginners and affordable...sound is  good enough,4
Satisfied with the product...,3
Don't buy,1
"first i was looking for a cheap guitar, but this is the worst guitarTHE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE FRETBOARD AND THE STRING IS VERY HIGH... SO YOU CANT PLAY ANY CHORDS YOU CAN PLAY ONLY ONE STRING SONGS WHICH IS BORINGSTRINGS ARE NOT GOODYOUR FINGERS HURT A LOTIF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A CHEAP GUITAR BETTER BUY IT PHYSICALLY keeping in mind the above problems OR BUY YAMAHA F280 its 6000rs",1
"I'm beginner , I watched videos on YouTube and bought this product but I don't know why this doesn't sound like I watched on YouTube.So after a day of my order delivery I took it to expert of instruments she said it is completely worth less only we can use it for photography and child play , this sure looks like guitar but doesn't sound like it, it's material is worst .Please don't buy even if u r a beginner please buy bit expensive than this because it's material is so bad and u will waste your money.",1
"This is truly a deal breaker... Awesome product compared to its price. But the strings gets more tensed, when properly tuned,which may result in breaking. Overall it is perfect for a beginner!!",4
It's ok ok not very much good.,3
"The product is fine but disappointed to see that a peice of wood was dilapidated at the bottom, except that everything is fine. A good option for beginner students. I bought it at the lightning deal for rupees 2190 . Worth the price 👍",4
This guitar is value for money for beginners.,4
"If you are a complete beginner and wish to start from a budget friendly Guitar, the this will perfectly suit you. The quality of the Guitar is amazing. Don't even think about anything else if you are tigh on budget. It's amazing. Got for ₹1,700 on sale.The delivery of the product was amazing. There was no way this could get damaged in transit.",5
This is worst product i have ever bought very cheap quality dont buy it. Within a month it has been broken and i went to a shop for repair bit they said its wood is very cheap it can not be repair,1
Good for beginners ....it work properly upto 6-7 month after this interval of time guitar neck will be damaged... Soo... My suggestion to  beginner if you are not confident that you are able to learn guitar Continuesly then buy this otherwise by at least 5-9thousand rs/- guitar,5
product was good and there was no damages.  But the bag zip broken.,4
From some places the paint is not well and there are some scratches too.,4
"this guitar is really osm.....sound quality is amezingggg..packeging is unbheliveable.just care fully tuned means slowly one's  and aftar that play how you want.look,colour,sound,packeging,qulity is no one can give in this price..and 2000Rs for this product its ok im happy with that..😍😍😍😍😍😍my dreems comes true",5
"Guitar is good but strings is not good, my guitar's both(extra ) string was broken so ! I havegiven you 3 star 🌟!",3
Love u Amazon,5
Average,3
"If you are shorter in height,  less than 15 yrs of age or looking a guitar for your kid to begin with then it is a perfect product for you with the lowest price you get as it is not a jumbo guitar.Good Luck",4
"Good, bt Finniahing isn't too good.",4
I have purchased this product from amazon. It was delivered to me in 10 days. The size is small and the sound quality of the product is fine. It sounds like a little distorted while playing. But overall its a good and nice product.,4
For my Daughter....,5
"For the price, it is really great. Looks great.  comes with all the accessories ( a spare set of wire, spare picks, case etc.)The size is a bit small, and the finishing on the inside is a bit on the rougher side.Value for money.",4
It is really great for those who want to get their fingers on the guitar for the first time.,4
This is Better choice for beginner guitar learners. price not high for students .,4
I ordered two guitars and one was broken..it should be tightly packed with some good material,4
"I would say, Blindly Go for it. If you are beginner or want to practice on chords, this is the profuct you can snap without giving any second thought. It has good build quality and strings. Plus, lightweight material and decent finishing..you mayhave to tune using mobile app. Or you can take help from any expert... 👍👍 juarez guitar price keeps varying from 1999 to 2699..keep checking and book at lightening deal periods.",5
I really appreciate it... The way it sounds.... I didn't expect that it would be such great.... But it won't be standardly tuned and you need to do it by yourself.... The colour Rock,5
"It is only for beginners. The price is quite satisfactory and budget friendly.Its sound good.Built quality good.Its came up with a guitar cover, two nos of pic, guitar holding strap.Thanks for readingIf you found it is helpful then press the helpful button.",5
Good for beginners like me.,4
I liked it,5
"Good, for beginners. If someone is planning to learn guitar then it is a good product at this rate. Very happy to buy the item and delivered the same neatly.",4
It's too good for its lowest price and it's also good as beginners,4
That was as perfect as I thought . They gave each item they said . And the product is perfect . I can't find out anything wrong about it . A good guitar worth it .,4
The pick and strings were missing in the package.,3
I bought this for my brother and it is awesome for beginners,4
The guitar is very much good. Sturdy and durable. It's a bit small I believe it's for kids or pre-teens. Unfortunately had to sell it on OLX. Found out I can't learn and play guitar with one month of practice watching YouTube;),4
Good product in this price reng bat bag quality is not good and guitar is only for business not for professional if you want to buy this product for your wish is it good for you,3
Nice black finish.strings are pretty good .best one for the beginners.,4
Not durable. Within one month strings are broke.,3
Its good guitar but small .its ohk m enjoying it,3
Strings are not good and arrangement of strings are not good,4
The action on the neck is too much so its super hard to play with . I realise its a risk you take when buying guitars online but this was too much . Besides that problem the guitar is well made and a good beginner guitar.,4
"Amazing products, delivery time good and fast servicesThank you all Amazon members",4
I received the guitar with 1 faulty string. To realise this it took me some time until which the return date had passed. Now when I call Amazon customer service regarding the warranty I don't get a proper response. I called 5 times and got 5 different responses and none of them have worked for me.,2
Nice product... Good one for beginners!,5
Best for beginners.. quality is good,4
Some scratches,4
"The Guitar is good for learning but,for adult it is small. The gap between strings is law so fingers doesn't feet with it. By the way for adult girls and kids about 15 years it is value for money. Good looking good sound and build quality.",4
Decent Product,3
Dislike: it is not having truss rod and within only 3-4 months the tension becomes high and the neck bends.Like: Best sound quality Perfect for beginners👍👍👍👍🙌🙌,5
Product is awesome  for beginners,4
"Good product for the cost , I purchased it. Real great deal for beginners. I will recommend this product for people who are thinking to learn guitar in near future",4
"I bought this Guitar in May 2017, initially everything was good, after some days I found that the fretboard is bent. I can't seem to find a repair shop for this. As per my knowledge the guitar comes with one year Warranty. But where to claim it? @Amazon please answer",3
It's working smoothly and it's best for the beginners,5
"Returning the product. When tuning, the bridge is coming out of the guitar. Looks like a refurbished product. Not recommend at ll. High action is needed to get proper notes. Strings are so hard, so it will be highly painful for fingers. This would give a bad impression to beginner guitarists.",1
Stings are broke after an hour,3
I liked this guitar.But it is very sensitive it will be broken very easily so that have to take care of it .No other issues except this one,4
The product is shorter than most. Its the best for beginners to learn and it also has extra strings and 2 picks with a bag and a strap.If you are looking for a wat to pass time in learning guitar this is the best way to go.,4
"Looking good, but string is not fitted well, also it was delivered in 4 days 😑",3
#good packng#sound avg#price good#fast delivery#wood low quality,4
I bought this for my husband ....he loves it. For beginners it's really good option.,4
The quality of the string and bridge is not good. It's broken when we try to set Tune within 4 months.,1
Good Product for beginners,4
Best a person could have in such amazing price.,5
Product is good but guitar bag is not ..even it is smaller then guitar ..guitar is not fit in it..,3
"This product is good but after a month the strings performance is not good but it had another strings in itself,so don't worry about it.I and my friends have with it and I am learning basic chord and amazing my Friends.",4
Best acoustic guitar for beginners. The sound quality is very nice.,5
Yes,5
"Me and my brother bought from same company, his is 3 years old still perfect mine broken in 20 days. I know its cheap but not worth it(intern an juarez both sell Chinese guitars).Not recommend buy at tour own risk",2
"As i am basic learner of playing guitar, it suits for basic users, i hope the price also best in amazon compared to other e -comm sites.",4
"The guitar is good. Don't know much about the guitars but got it checked with one of my friends who is into it. The strings are good quality, cutting of wood is fine. Got extra set of strings and picks. Overall looks good, for beginners at least.",4
Good for a beginner if you want to learn . Make sure your guitar has  a good action (distance between your frets and strings). As a beginner I loved it but if you really ant to learn for a long time buy one with good sound quality and not this one.,3
Very helpful for beginners,4
It's an awesome product I didn't expect I can literally purchase guitar of good quality online but luckily I found this it's worth the price.,5
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 It's sound nice ,and good quality material used",5

The sound quality is average...Good for beginners.,3
Best for beginners...But in description rs. 6990/-And ther giving offer for rs.1990/-What I felt is guiter is not rs.6990/-This is below current price.,3
This product is great considering its price! Price is affordable. The main highlight its the sun's quality this guitar has!It is best for basic people who are learning guitar! Must buy!,4

No guide provided with this,3

"Price wise it's good ,got it in very good packaging n without any damages, build n sound is good .",3
"It is good for beginner, you can go for it in this price range.",4
"While tuning with guitar tuning app the E stainless string, which is the shortest first came lose then broke from the bottom side. Its Good that they have spare strings already given. Poor quality strings.Sound is good. Everything is okay.Guitar (beginners) 5/5Strings quality 2/5 (go for nylon strings)Sound. (5/5)Experience (3/5)Great quality except for stainless strings.",2
Nice product. But sound quality is not that great. Go for it if all you just want is fun. Not good for those who take the hobby seriously.,3
"Quality is not good. Strings are not proper, when you play it will not sound properly.",2
Good product according to the price.Good for beginners.,3
No doubt the price is too good. But if you want to gift someone or you wana just hang it on the wall you can buy it but if you wana learn guitar my watching you tube videos then do not buy the guitar as it is small and the channels are very less in this guitar. You cannot learn buy the guitar in the price range of 4000 thats a perfect guitar for learning.,2
This product is good for beginners,4
"Fantastic for beginners... Superb item.  I am not the guitarist so can't be more analytical about the technalities, but for beginners, itz superb..Some.issues are there with G & e strings...",4
It is a very good product for beginners but it don't have truss rod but again in this price it is negligibleGood in this price ₹3199,5
Its a nice product for such a price compared to others but the action is a little higher and difficult for begginers to deal with overall good product,3
Good quality affordable price but gap between string and fretboard is so high (action). Thats the only problem otherwise best guitar for beginners.,4
Not great Product But good for those who want to start learning,3
The action is too high ...,3
The packaging was not as good but I really liked it because it's really helpful for beginners and I am also a beginner :),5
How it sounds is secondary. I had doubts weather it will be handed to me in one peace or not. And the product is almost similar to that in the images,4
Very good at this price range,4
It's really good for beginners..... Don't take bad reviews seriously because may be the people who said bad about guitar are professional guitarist but it's really good in every manner,5
Good product.... Nic to start wit,4
Overall sound quality is okay.Has 18 frets. Whereas it should  be 21.Bridge and nut average quality.Color chipped off very first day..Strings are of good quality.And i dont think the wood is maplewood or indian rosewood as it shouls be naturally.,3
Good product for beginners at a very low price...,4
5 star for Amazon delivery on time n good packaging n for good service guitar is also good for beginners it sounds good i loved it and while tuning 1 string got broken so be careful n go for it good product,4
Good for beginners but it's first fret is to small it causes to hurt in our finger when we play E or B string in first fret,4
"Good for beginners,Easy to learn,good sound quality,was in good condition",5
The product was nice and awesome for beginners go for it and buy this guitar,5
Thanx juraze it's really good for beginners but {i  received it some damage }but I would handled it😊  it's sound note is wow peak also qualitative nd guitar also cool nd favorable in this prize ... feeling happy thanx Amazon,5

"Better one to learn for beginners,",5
Great sound quality in this price range.,4
Best guitar to buy for the beginners.It comes with the cover and all necessary accessories to tune the guitar and also extra strings are present.A good idea to gift it to someone who is learning to play guitar.The surface is clean and with a little shine.,5
Sound okFor beginners very goodBut the problem is with the strings it blends the fingers,5
Superb,5
"Awesome guitar fro Juarez at an unbelievable deal. I bought it for my daughter after a long research and real search. The packing was excellent, as somebody had already said, that will easily fool others for a 40"" LED TV box. Well packed and well delivered on dot on the ETA. The size is perfect for my daughter. The carry bag, strap, strings supplied were of good quality. One can't expect more. Thank you Amazon once again.",5
Nice sound Quality,4
Go for it if you are looking a proper (but not very good) sound without spending more money,4
To good,5
All scratches on guitar,1
Sound quality not so good but overall its good for beginners,3
Great value for money as I wanted it for practice for my 11 yr old daughter at home.,4
Average but after 2 months fretboard was bend,4
Not a quality product.Just a working product to simply get awareness about guitar,4
This product is very amazing and sound quality is very well.it is good for beginners and also learn guitar .the packaging is very well maintained.,5

Don't buy it,1
"I like the guitar.Looks good, produces good sound,Good price Range.But a major drawback is playing first fret on each string. Need to press the strings real hard to produce sound any sound. Painful to an extent.Hence rating 3.But Beginners, go ahead and buy it.",3
"Good for beginners, smooth and light.",5
"As per the price it's a good buy, may be size not fit for tall people , check dimension before buying .",4
Great sound quality and light weight guitar.Did not receive the plectrum and the quality of the bag is quite poor. The paint on the guitar is ruined at a few places.,3
"Good for beginners, quality is also durable",4
Pasand,5

"Finally i got my product, but product was little damaged. A crack on the backside wooden panel. So i request to replace my order. By the way product is good in this price range.",1
Delivered on time without any scratches or wear and tear. Plays absolutely fine. Although a little smaller than the usual size but you dont have to play it in the rock concert of AR Rahman. So as far as size is concerned it is ideal for an amateur person willing to learn guitar.,5
AVerage ... strings not so good...SOUnd average..,4
Everything good but the gap between stings and Friet board is large. It should be less for better performance.,4
Smart good and talend for the beginning who think to learn and for photoshoot it's very amsome for just 2k cost almost well satisfaction,5
Good for biginers and sound quality is batter then price an it's not easy to play but you can learn.,2
To much,4
Received damaged product.,3
"I absolutely love this guitar. It sounds perfect. Also, it comes with a spare set of strings. This is a great product for someone who is just starting to play the instrument and does not have much experience. Altogether, it is worth buying at such a discounted price.",5
This was a gift for my girlfriend. She doesn't know how to play guitar but she liked it. Best at its​ cost. I hope it'll last until she learns she basics.,4
The guitar is awesome but the picks are too badMy picks got broke in one week.,4
Very good in this price range. Excellent for beginners...,4

https://amzn.to/3de0aPFBought it dor 1790rs under offer.1.Looks same as mentioned in the picture2.Best for a beginner3.Quality is good.,5
Worth for price. Good for beginners...,4
The Guitar I gifted to my nephew and he loved it. If you don't want to shell out a bomb on a guitar and want to learn as a beginner suggest to buy this one.,4
"Delivered on time, packaging was perfect and I love the Guitar I suggest you to buy it.🎸",5
"Great sound quality for an acoustic guitar at this dirt cheap price, comparable to Rs. 8k+ ones. I wish there was bridge adjustment mechanism as the steel strings are real hard to press at the top frets, you got to develop callous on ur fingertips for few days before you can play those, unlike classical with nylon strings. Worth every penny though.",5
"best guitar ....great sound quality.......look for other guitar only if you have a budget of more than 10k (assuming that you don't have any guitar till now) ........p.s: writing this review after 2 months approx and after learning 2-3 songs.......dude, if I took the effort to write this review, then believe me...like really believe me , it got something in it !!!!",5
This guitar is very nice for bignners,5
🖕🖕,4
Neck isn't strong enough. Nuts are worst. String arnt good quality and fret wire came out and fret board swallon,2
Awesome product for beginners.... super easy to learn and the sound quality is just fab... loved the item....❤❤❤,5
"The 'action' (distance between fretboard and strings) height is way too much. Not at all for beginners, as they will never be able to learn on it ever. Because of this huge action height, the finger tips would sour very quickly, trying to press the strings over the frets, I am afraid. Even for a fine veteran guitarist, the high action height means poor playability of the guitar. The overall product quality is horrible. And there is no truss-rod in the fretboard to make any adjustments, if one wishes. Moreover, the fretboard itself is awful and is made up of plastic, and would give-in any day. The top wood is very thin and does not look durable. Not worth a single rupee. And there is no money-back return policy. You can, at best, only ask for a replacement. So think twice before buying it.",1
"I liked it. According to its price, it is a good guitar. It has nylon strings which is good for beginners. Because nylon strings are not hard to press as compare to steel strings. If you want to learn a guitar, you can go with this guitar.",5
Initially received a product and String broke while I tried to tighten it. I was disappointed but now happy with replaced one .Worth for its price good guitar for beginners.,4
"A good guitar for beginner level. The wood material is  way too good than what I expected ,along carrying case & extra set of strings. Under this price tag, definitely it's too worth. Thank you for the amazing product ❤️",5

The guitar is very good at this price but the only problem is that the low E string csn not be tuned perfectly it is always going up and down,4
"For 1990, it was quite a deal. The packaging was very good. The quality of the material used was okay, but good for its price. And most importantly, the sound was very good, again for its price. Even better than some full sized guitars. So far so good, my nephew better love it.",5

Gud quality for beginners,3

NICE,4
Very bad. Please my comments. Never buy this guitar in your life. E string will break. So bad quality. Can't tune that string either. Did not get bag and accessories also first time. On return I got the accessories. But the B and E string were not getting tuned proper again. The tuner knob doesn't retain tension well on the strings.,1
I like the guitar and the chip of the guitar is very strong  and it is easy to play..😁😁😁😁😋😋,5
I had a very pathetic experience with this guitar.Don't buy this. Please read this completely.Disadvantages are as below1) strings are very tight and hard2) low quality strings3) sound quality average4) tuning pegs gets hard with time5) very small frets6) more gap between the fretboard and the strings.7) asymmetrical8) strings are very hard and it gives burning sensations every time i play the guitar.,1
Awesome guitar in this price range but the fretboard and size of guitar is  little smaller than general size of  guitar.,4
It is a good product aound quality is also good.,5
Its good for begginers,5
The first one is broken... But this replacement i got is very good comparing with the price.. n it's good for beginner like meThank you  Amazon🙏,4
The guitar was safely delivered and the quality is bang on.. and for beginners its the best instrument...,5
Sounds different from normal acoustic guitars.,4
Guitar I like it,5
The base of the guitar is very high unable to concentrate on the rhythm,3
Nice great guitar for the beginners,4
On this price it is the best you can get,4
The guitar is excellent no words for the guitar........But the delivery was soo worst the box was damagedPlease take care of the delivery tooThanks,4
It's not perfectly tuned (placement of it's frets is not proper). Best choice for beginners though.,4
For beginners,3
Nice gitar,5
Very good in this price range. I'm trying to learn . Good sounds and finishing of the body. No any damage. Go for it........,4
"For beginners, it's value for money. Value can be enhanced if Kepo is included.",5
Good for beginners. Not so high quality guitar.  Though string provided for high pitch breaks easily if tried to tune perfectly. So good for new learner's.,3
Good for beigners but strings are not much stronger.. this can be much improved,4
The Action is very high. It's way higher than ordinary high. The Action is the gap between the strings and the base board. A professional guitarist will not be able to play the guitar having action this high. It will hurt your fingers. So if you are a beginner then please check the action. If it's too high then replace it. I opted for replacement but i don't know if they will send the guitar with same action.,1
excellent product,4
Good for begineers. But strings and tuning pegs are of not good quality but at this price you cant expect more.,4

"Quality is not good.It started breaking from back of it's fret board only when left tuned for a SINGLE NIGHT (see the pinned pic)NO TRUSS ROD, which is also lead to negative marking for durability.I'll not recommend you to buy. You can spend a little more money to buy better GUITAR.",2

If you're a beginner then it's a good guitar. But if you want decent sound quality then go for Pluto or YAMAHA F310.The sound quality is not good enough but at this price this is the best guitar.,5
The product is really good. The quality evrythng is perfect,5
"Just go for it!!Just one thing to keep in mind, strings that come with guitar is of bad quality I broke high E strings while tuning in both sets, one that comes embedded on guitar and the one that is extra, then I purchased ""Alice A206 Phosphor Bronze Guitar Strings"" and it worked just great.",5
This guitar is very nice but its nice,4

Nice products i been using from long.Learning purpose its good,5
Good Sound Quality,4
Everything was fine but the tuning strings was not able to tune either going on high frequency or low frequencyWhile playing chords the chords was disturbing other strings due to low quality fret work,2
It’s not recommended..especially for beginners. Not good for learning.,2
"People would think that it’s a steal at just Rs. 5000 but in reality they just steal your money. This thing is just a piece of wood with strings. 3 of them broke when I was tuning it for the first time, and it never sounded accurate.You can call it a beginners guitar if you don’t really care about the perfect sound and just want to get comfortable strumming and learning new notes.",1
Mast,5

"good product in this budget,sound is not as good as guitars of or above 3000but overall a good product under this budget.",3
More than worth,4
Guitar looks good..but the action in on higher side...need to press the strings with high force to make sound.. Surely not good for beginners...its good for photoshoots and to hang on walls as showpiece..,3
Not good so,3
It's 🆗 👍,3
its just lovely.  I do not know much about professional guitars as i'm a beginner and for a beginner its very good..... reasonably priced and very very good.  I have just purchased this product and yet to use it.  But overall I liked the feel of it.,5

It is amazing....I really loved it.....🤩🤩🤩,5
"Excellent guitar🎸 for the beginners. However, the there is slight tense sound which makes you afraid of while tightening string knobs",5
The sound quality is good.But the distance between string and fret-board is too high causing it to press harder. Also switching between chords isn't smooth because of pressing hard,3
worthy For Your Money And will Be helpful if u r a beginner but going out of tune Regularly.,4
Awesome .... And very beautiful...and good packaging .,5
Awesome to learn in cheap price sounds good best quality colour no defects.👏👏,5
You can't play all the tunes,4
This guitar is actually good for beginners,5
Received the package in good condition. But it contained only the guitar. No accessories were included. Hence returning it. Guitar is good for beginners. Size is average.,3
"I bought this product to learn guitar. First time when the guitar arrived it had loose strings. Returned that guitar, when new guitar came after a week, it didn't have extra guitar strings, guitar pick and even the guitar bag was torn. Very disappointed with this purchase. Waste of money and time.",1
Good for beginners..,3
I got this guitar for 1999rs. I am a beginner and this guitar suits my purpose perfectly. And also great service from Amazon.,4
Most of the reviews here are misleading. The guitar isn't very good for beginners. The action is very high and you have to press the strings real hard to get the proper sound. This makes chord transitions a nightmare when you play the songs. Also my b string broke within a month. Won't recommend it.,2
More space between Frets and string,3
For beginner...  It's best Product ever,4
The first string broke with in an hour after delivery. And the second string broke with in two days also the freds are less . Plssss dont buy its too bad,1
Good one,3

I have buy one 2 years ago.. I m still using it.. you have to change string with standard strings set like D'Addario strings and it will perform like standard guitars. ONLY FOR BEGINNERS ...INTERMEDIATE SHOULD TRY VAULT GUITAR IF THEY DONT HAVE ENOUGH BUDGET,5

Good sound produced. However there was some chipping on curve. Also string 1 got damaged (broke) within a week. Spare was helpful.,4
I am ordering with high hope that it will be quite good for beginners but I am wrong. The arm is not straight and very hard to tune. And after tuning the string went off-key frequently. I want to return but I have damaged all the package. It is very frustrating.,1

Awesome product.... Come with excellent packaging.... Solid....,5
"Guitar is okay, not so great but it is good for kids.The rest of the accessories are worst you can find. So if  you are thinking are you getting a deal with all that things free with guitar, its not worth it. The bag was all soiled and there was mold growing on it everywhere. The strap, picks and extras strings are all very very low quality.",2

"Since my kid is left handed, went to the guitar shop to change string for left handed use. The guy at the shop said, this is worst quality of guitar and you will be lucky if it will last for more than 6 months. So far 3/4 different guitar experts have cautioned about not buying these type of guitars as these are not well made and have trouble tuning. The string break easily. I would recommend people putting more money and buying a good quality guitar instead of this one, This might work for photobooth.",1
"The guitar has no pick guard, and less fret points. Strings qualities are OK, but sound overall is annoying a little. I won't recommend buying this unless you really don't want to spend more than 2.5k.",2

"Fret length is too small, strings are so gentle that one Stroke and you will have it all in your hands.And amazon is not allowing to return this item, hence making this more frustrating experience.Only Packing is good",1
A good instrument for beginners and a good quality product according to the price,5
"The fret was kinda damage, no fret marking on the neck of the guitar, the gap between the neck and the string was too high. The pick felt so cheap when holding and is easily malleable. A mediocre product. But you cant expect more at this price range. Wouldnt recommend for a beginner who wants to learn.",2
Its not too good not too bad but nice at this price,2
Dont expect good quality for such a cheap item,3

Guitar handle bar is too short it's only use for kids other wise guitar is awesome build quality is superb,2
The strings are so high up from the fretboard that it is impossible to play any chords. You need micro fingers of steel to play this guitar. Brought this seeing all the positive reviews saying its good for beginners. But I guess all of it was a joke.,1

what a lovely sound this guitar has.. never expected it could sound so good.. but the guitar is not very strong.. it should not b fallen.. thin quality mixed wood... njoy,5
"This guitar's quality is not equal to the MRP 6990. If you compare this product with Yamaha and holmer of MRP 9000 their quality is top most  . It looks to me that the MRP of this guitar is inflated. When I saw this guitar, it looks like manufacturer has made this guitar for name sake. There is thin wood. The strings are not springs like the one in Yamaha guitar's. The body is glossy which shows finger prints when touched. The tuners are not durable.",1

"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Frankly speaking this is good for kids but not for one who really wants to learn. As beginner you will find difficulty in playing because of fret and the strings are quite at much more distance than normal if you really want to get into playing then go for other guitar add 1k or 2k and buy some decent one not this.For example you can go for vault e20 costs around 4k but it is worth it.",2

Product is amazing at this price,5
Very hard to.tune,1
First of all th packaging was not good.... Packaging was damage and this guitar does not have good sound quality...!!!!!Lastly the guitar was damaged containing defects scratch!!!....,1
Quality of the guitar is not bad. The strings are too high off the fretboard. Poor quality strings. Strings cut right away while tuning and the extra set of strings had 2 same B strings n no E string. Will have to order another set of strings. Will never go for a beginner/cheap guitar again. Don't buy this!!!,1

It is just for very basic learning. Dont expect a quality guitar. Substandard product I would say with very short life.Spend a 1000 bucks extra and get one of a better quality.I got this for around 1700 (including SBI card discount). Not worth to spend even a single penny extra above this price.,1

"As a layman (who doesn't know much about guitars) this product is awesome... It feels good, it sounds good, the strings are good... Before buying it, I researched a little bit and came to a conclusion that this the best (considering the MRP) beginners / learning guitar you can have. Ofcourse there are one or two things which may bother you once you learn more about guitar and chords and frets. But if you are just starting, this is the one to go with.",5

Guitar quality is good as per the price. For learning only. I was not provided with accessories thought. 3 stars.,2
superrbbbbbbb...i was hesitating to buy this....but after recieving this guitar i am very happy,5
Bad guitar..... Worst guitar I never seen....😠😠😠,1
It's worse. I can't tune it for three days. Sound quality is at it's worse. It's a baby guitar.,1
Everything is Good but Strings gap with the Guitar's neck is too much By which it is not working well,1
As a beginner I ordered this guitar as it had a complete kit (every guitar has). A few days all seemed fine except the neck was aligned to a different angle. And the strings are too closely attached that it always mutes some strings. Buy a second hand on olx. I got a Givson semi electric guitar for 2500.,1
Nice.. learning on this new music machine,5
It doesn't Tune,1
Its very beautiful low in price and excellent finishing......i u r thinking to buy please go for it....,5

Guitar is bend. Strings are not placed properly on fret-board. Pretty cheap stuff.When I requested seller for return I got blunt reply that our product is not for testing. If it is prime product then there must be an option for return. Waste of my money. Better pay more and buy a good stuff.,1

I like this guitar it's very good,5
original cost of this guitar is nearly 800 INR. NOt at all good. I bought this as i was a beginner that time and it was really tough to play the distance between fretboard and Strings are too much that your fingers will swell if you will play continously even for half n hr .,1
The best product and is value for money definitely. Thank you Amazon.,5
Loved it .,5
Excellent product for that price.,5
A star for the delivery and all but the guitar was just not good. The guitar's bridge wasn't properly made so I couldn't even tune the first string and I've already broken two strings (I had even taken help from my sir to tune and he said the guitar's not good like the bridge isn't straight and all),1
"Very poor quality woodIt got broken down in three daysWood could not withstand traction of tightened stringhs even for three daysSound was good for price, thoughAnyways, I got what I paid for😉😂",1

gud money for the cost,5
"Tiny guitar. Do not buy this guitar without understanding what the 38 inch means. You will be disappointed if you have ever seen or touched a guitar before. Bad quality strings, wood, bag and literally everything that comes in the pack. Maybe except the pick. Which is alright.",1

don purchase this guitar waste of money ....and quality of this guitar is not good ...,1
The package did not have strings and 2 picks as noted in the included items. Now I need to buy them separately.,1
"I have this guitar since 4 years now. I bought this when I wasn't having any idea about guitars, it's quality, etc. I found it cheap so I purchased it.But later on when I joined a guitar class, I got to know that it's sound quality & overall wood quality isn't good.There's no metal rod to support the neck which is why it can get bent easily.The wood is just ""Bhusa ply"" which means it's made from saw dust so it isn't good.I'd suggest that don't buy Juarez. There are many other brands like Aria, hobmer, revolt, etc which are available offline with just 1k-2k extra around 4.5k, 5k, etc",2

"Here’s what you need to know before you read this review; first, I am not a professional musician/guitar player; however, I consider myself quite a musical person and I do own a few musical instruments including some  Casio and Yamaha keyboards, flutes and have owned some very professional musical studio equipment including sound boards like AWE64 and 32 from Creative; of course, I have reviewed tons of these kind of things in the past.So, I have done quite a bit of messing around, just not a ‘professional’ type; keep that in mind. So, if you are looking at this guitar, probably you are starting out, or you simply don’t want to spend too much money on getting one of the bigger brand names; whatever, it is I hope this review helps you decide.What I liked——————+ The packaging. Amazon literally went overboard with this, the box I received the guitar in could easily be mistaken for a 40” LCD TV. In fact, I actually thought, they sent me a TV instead of a guitar. Oh how I wish :)+ Very Good Build quality.  For the price, the build quality is a shocker, it’s really good and I love the colour - black, smooth and nice. There were no dings or anything, which I could find with an eagle eye. However, it’s quite light, and you might now want to drop it; it may take a drop or two, but I would just strap it on first.+ The size and weight. At 38 inches, the size is pretty good and being light weight it’s comfortable to hold.+ The accessories. For a guitar, all the accessories are included - you get the strap, replacement strings, two picks and a nylon carrying case. That’s super nice. If you are going to use this guitar to start learning, the additional strings will help, in case you break the original.+ The notes. If you are buying a guitar, you obviously want to know how clean the notes were. I would say to my ears, perfect. Just remember to tune it before you start, which is pretty important.What I didn’t Like————-————- Nothing. Yeah, I actually loved this guitar all through. I can’t even think of anything to nick pick.What else do you need to know——————————————————1. If you are buying this guitar or any other guitar, you will need to tune it right. So, make sure you do that before you play it. You can use a tuning box, or you can simply get an App like GuitarTuna. I got it tuned pretty perfectly with in a few minutes.2. Clean the strings. It will last longer.3. Playing a guitar takes a lot of practice; meaning don’t just expect yourself to become Jimi Hendrix in an hour of getting one. As an amateur guitar player, I am still learning the ropes. And did I tell you that it hurts after fretting for a while.Should you buy it?————————Yes.I definitely recommend getting this guitar for the price it is at - if you want to learn a guitar, or start with one; it will surprise you at that; it’s even cheaper than buying a used guitar. Once you get the hang of it and learn more; you can get yourself a more expensive one.Hope this review helps you decide.",5

Guitar has high action ( i.e. Distance of strings from board is very large compared to guitars for beginners) and this may resent you from practicing it regularly. I got it for 1.5k so I am not so much disappointed. But I'll definitely not recommend this guitar for beginners.,3

Worst quality!,1
Worst condition of guitar 😤,1
"Most of the good reviewers must not have played this guitar for more than a week. When I initially bought it I thought it was a great purchase. I am a beginner so initial weeks of learning guitar was going well. Then I came across the dreaded F Major bar chord, that's when I realized the glaring problem this guitar has. The Action (distance between guitar and fretboard) is too high ! I tried modifying it using allen key provided but to no avail. I showed it to a friend of mine (who is a pro) who said the guitar design is flawed. Please don't buy this if you're genuinely trying to learn guitar. If you are trying to learn on your own you will easily get duped by such faulty designs. Get a recommendation from a friend before buying !",1
If u are a beginner the best affordable guitar.  Been using it for 3 and a half years no problem so far its small and easy to take along and lightweight,5
Product not so genuine,1
faulty product received,1
"Hi Namaste everyone,I just brought this guitar 2 weeks before,I'm just a beginner so I don't know much about guitar. So I thought of buying a budget guitar to study basics and I started my classes...Now I realized that my guitars fret board have a bend it's a born bend friends. And this guitar have no truss rod so it's not possible for you to adjust the fret bend... I suggest you all to buy a much better guitar ( beginner's too). Don't go for this kind of budget one, I don't know what to do with this guitar now.maybe I place in my show case..Guys collect money and buy a good guitar above mentioned is the truth I faced.i studied about this fret bends then I understood that this budget guitar's fret board will automatically bend with in 6 months, and will not get proper quality sound and also finger pain.So say no... And go for a good one God bless you all",2

"Sound  quality is not good,",1
"The guitar for the price of Rs.2000 is pretty good.Below are the pros and cons of the guitar:-Pros-1.It is pretty good if you are not sure whether or not you're gonna continue playing guitar.2.Its sound is bright for the size of its sound hole and body.3.Spaces between the frets are pretty accurate so if you decide to continue playing it will not be of great problem.Cons:-1.It does not have a truss rod.A truss rod is supposed to support a guitars neck which is the fret part.2.If you already know how to play a guitar DO NOT buy this product instead invest a little more and go for better brands.2.It has only 18 frets which is not a problem for beginners but will create a chaos once you have to use notes above the 18th fret.3.Its finishing and wood work inside the body is not accurate which may result in the guitar sounding odd at times.4.The tuning pegs are very hard and will give you a problem while you have to tune it.To conclude:-Only buy this guitar if you're not sure whether or not you'll continue playing guitar.If you've made tour mind that you wanna play guitar,invest just a little more and you'll open a gate to many other better brands.If you're already a guitarist;stay away.",3
"Nice sound quality!!  Truly worth to this prize, It's good for beginners!!",4
String quality is poor. It is broken,1
Did not get the pick or strap,1
"4 of my students already purchased this guitar before coming to me for classes and there are lot of issues in this guitar. For starters, intonation is really bad (which means 'besura' notes in layman's language) The bridge will come out after few months because the quality is cheap. One student has already faced this issue. There is no 'truss rod' as well which means there is no way to adjust action. And there are many more issues which a non-musician won't understand. If you go on OLX, you'll find many of this same guitar lying there to be sold 2nd hand because after joining guitar class and showing it to their guitar teacher, students realize how horrible the guitar is. A humble request for beginners - please don't buy guitar BEFORE joining guitar class. Your guitar teacher doesn't deserve that kind of torture to their EARS! 🤣 Ask your teacher first, and then buy. Don't trust your own judgement. Just because something makes SOUND doesn't mean it's good to use. This is more like a toy, not a guitar. Don't trust the reviews here as well. Majority of these reviews are written by beginners who have bad or average music-sense! Also, kindly upvote this review (click on the helpful button so that it appears on top) I am fed up of seeing this guitar in my class. If I see one more of this guitar in my class I swear I'll go crazy! Click on the HELPFUL button. I want every damn beginner in the world to read this!",1

"If you are beginner, then please dont buy this guitar practice,  first the frets are so long its very tough for the chord progress, i almost gave up playing guitar becoz of this, i thought my fingers were so small cant able to able catch up the chords but truth is frets are so long.. u cant play on this guiatr for beginner layer. Just becoz the cost is low doesnt mean u can play well on this guitar well its my opinion.  Now i am gonna buy new one.. its my fault who bought this guitar out of excitement.. plz dont do the mistake like me.. buy a good one tho its costly its gonna stay longet throughout your journey. ALL THE BEST",1
"sound quality good , easy to learn, but strings are some weak.. but it is good product with minimum cost..",5
At this price it's ok to buy.,4
"The product was damaged..I'm so pissed off.. It was supposed to be a gift for my sister.. and I demand compensation for ruining the customer satisfaction.. And I've ordered for a replacement which will certainly arrive after my sister has left.. You guys ruined the whole moment.. How ungraceful..Edit : 25/8/2020,Got the replacement and the sharp smell of paint or whatever the furnishing thing is applied makes me want to puke. It's so annoying why there has to be something that bothers the buyer.. The last product didn't have any unpleasant scent.. but this one is something suffocating..Imperfect furnishing, if I knew it was going to be this bad, I would have preferred something that's not painted at all.",1
Were having many issues with the product. I returned it.,1
Good product and  awesome bulid quality nice sound quality. Value for money guiter. For beginners it's a good choice go for it,5
HORRIBLE GUITAR1) Strings are really bad quality. They hurt your fingers and you can not play at all if u have dry skin.2) the sound quality is so bad. I heard a song from a an acoustic guitar which was like much more expensive than this one and the sound was awesome there. For this guitar u really have to press hard on the fret board for clear sound and that too is not good. The f major chord sound comes realy weird in this3) the distanceeeeeee between the fret board and strings is so much that u can't play properly without hurting your fingers.4) in the first month itself it got scratches and dents all over it. 5) it won't last long cz it doesn't have a rod inside it so if u don't play it for a while all the strings will come out. A good quality guitar alwayysss stands long.PLEASE DONT BUY THIS GUITAR TO SAVE MONEY OR IF U THINK THAT IT INCLUDES EVERYTHING. YOU'RE REALLY GONNA REGRET IT,1

The product arrived on 26 one day before EDD the workman ship is above average light damage at the neck paint is not good peeling off at some places produces good sound tuned with the help of guitar tuna app all part of the product received in good condition amazon packing was amazing light weight so need to handle with care value for money at Rs 2600/- good for beginners like me . a beginners guitar before one graduate to pro it is worth for its price. The bag size is small it is very tight and bag itself is made of ordinary quality needs restiching. As u can c in the picture the bag is tight while zipping besides light damage at the neck,3
another product given,1
Good for beginners.. But not for professionals.. Best at this price,3
You have to keep tunning it frequently which is very tough for a beginners. Not meant for beginners who want to genuinely learn guitar,2
Good prodect,4
Received damaged piece,1
I gifted this to one of my friend... And she is very happy with it she loved it...Best choice for beginners.,5
Most Important point that no one will tell about you this guitar that this guitar is irreparable. Once the guitar action gets high you can't fix it in the shop because it doesn't have a truss rod which is a very important part of a guitar. Its tone is also very poor. I will suggest you buy a toy rather than buying this. Please buy a guitar from an instrument shop nearby. Maybe it's a little expensive than this but that will sound like a guitar.,1
worst dont buy anyone,1
1. The normal action on a guitar is 2.8 mm to 3 mm whereas on this guitar the action is 6 mm which is definitely going to hurt the fingers more than it should.2. The quality of the strings is poor.You need to tune this guitar twice or thrice a day or maybe even more which is terrible3. The sound quality is fine for this price .4. Overall this guitar is not worth it and it's better to purchase a guitar that you can play without losing a finger or two in the process,1
"Just good,",1
It's good,1
It's good for beginnersSound quality is amazing 😍Package is very good 👍,4
"The product was better then the expectation , action is also 0.4 inch, only the pick was hard look beautiful but useless for beginners,",5
"The guitar is useless. Waste of money.Not suitable for any living thing.Quality bad, sound bad waste of everything.",1
This product is awesome choice for beginners,4
"The issues are of String quality and distance between string and fretboard(seems like a mile), otherwise it's perfect choice!!!",4
Every Guitar should have TRUSS ROD inside the guitar fret board but this guitar doesn't have... Bcz of this this guiter fret board easily get bend n we can not play bend guitar. Means the gape between fret board n strings gets more.. it'll hurt your finger badlyBuy guitar with truss rod or don't buy anything,1
All are gud but side handle was little damaged..... I really upset after seen the damage handle..... 😥😥,3
"Good for beginners.,good sound quality..,but the gap between the strings and fret platform is too long.",4
Go for another brand. It hurts alot so much very very much etc. Hurted my baby's fingers. Such a worst expe,1
first fret strings are hard to play cause of much gap in wood.. overall good,3
Use less product don't buy this buy some good product  it's not worth it so don't go for it .,1
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Good for beginners.",4
"So if i could ban and remove this guitar off this website and punch the person who makes these guitars in the face, I WOULD CERATINLY DO THAT !!This guitar is a TOY GUITAR , it does not have a truss rod , which is used to fix the guitar's action(to make it comfortable to play) , I teach guitar and this guitar is a nightmare for any bigenner student , this is NOT A GUITAR , it is a toy guitar , it does not even have the full parts to be even called a guitar.Take my advice , save some money everyone and invest in a guitar WITH A TRUSS ROD! SO YOU CAN FIX IT WHEN THE ACTION INCREASES.As far as Juarez goes , i hope i get to visit your factory one day so i can burn it to the ground and take a leak on the ashes , stop fooling people you cheapsters. Get this guitar OFF THIS WEBSITE.",1
Nice Product,4
Nice Nd it is worth for what v had paid,4
I don't know I am a bird singer but not a Guthrist. My daughter is happy with her lifetime gift.,5
Best for beginners at this price. Love it. Easy to use. Received without any defects. It was Packed well. Recommended!,5
I think this guitar is good for beginners and it's easy to learn but sound quality is not so good,5
It's worth  money. Looks classy . Good for beginners. Sound quality Is also very good. I m very happy with this product.,5
"Product is good for beginners. ..I have no queries wit the productBut,  I'm not satisfied with the deliveryDidn't received my item at given address...I'm saying this bcoz the item was huge ..and it made me difficult to carry to my destination",3
quality is goor or average but they give me blue colour instead of black.,3
"Honest Review:Pros: If your budget is really tight then you can go for this guitar. Overall at this price range it is satisfactory.Cons:1. Guitar does not have truss rod. After 2-3 months action of the guitar will increase and you will be struggling to play the guitar and cannot adjust the action as well.2. Built quality is very cheap. While sliding over the frets fingers get hurt.3. Sound quality is average as the sound box is not big.4. After few months tuning keys of the guitar catch rust and you can barely move the tuning keys. Im facing this difficulty for B and E_high string.If you are a beginner and think that you will learn with a cheap guitar first and then buy a good guitar then please don't believe this myth. Branded and good quality guitar produce superb quality sound and keep you motivated. If you fall in this trap of cheap guitar which will not produce a premium sound you may end up demotivated and ultimately leave playing guitar. So if you can afford, if you have some extra money, buy a good guitar, save some money, wait for few months and save and buy a branded guitar around 10-15K budget.",1
Very cheap quality Guitar.Not for beginners & nor fr professionals.While tuning the guitar strings started breaking due to tension.& seller have kept return period of 7 days knowing the quality of guitar.No support too after purchase..Better to buy from local store than wasting money here..,1
Overall superb,4
Sound is not so gd. Otherwise ok.,2
Product Was nice for beginners no doubt...But String fixation was weaker than other similar product with same range.,4
Initially I received a damaged product. But sound was awesome. I replaced it. This time sound is not as good as earlier one. Not that impressive. Guitar pick is broken.,2
"Never buy this guitar for beginners bcouz its  fretboard  is made of plastic. And its sound quality is like as we say like besuri you can't even play your chords properly. It's nobs are made of plastic thats why it is not able to tight your strings and if you have tighten up strings but after sometimes it losen as it. And we if talk about its bag, string, belt and all its accessories are made up of very cheap quality. So, those people who are buying there first guitar never ever buy this guitar beacuse I have wasten my money for this but you don't plzzz I am suggesting you those are reading my review.",1
"This toy don't have any ""Tresrod"" If there is any bend we can't repair it. It's a bot. And ppl with out knowing it just buying it. And it contains plastic bridge. Actually guitar is made up of wood.",1
The product is amazing ☺️. The quality is mind blowing....worth it.. product is fabulous in such low price. Impressed by the quality.,5
Small and compact suitable for beginners. But not so small.,4
"It is the worst product. It is preferable to buy from offline store than online. I got a bent one, my fretboard is bent.",2
Best for begginers... and it can be a good gift,4
should we get warranty  on this guitarhow many months do we get warranty on this jaqrz guitar in black,5
The gap between strings and frets makes it harder to play the guitar for beginners. It might hurt your fingers too.,1
"So far I have broken two strings in just a week worth of play and while tuning, go for a better quality one",2
It's good for beginners...& Sound quality is good 👌,4
Good guitar for beginners as it's very cheap only ₹1990/-Be careful when your using with your bare hands as it will hurt. Overall the guitar is a Super quality item with that price.,4
So is it worthy to purchase this product ...bcuz I am a beginner but I personally like n belive in strong and good condition product so please help me me.bhaskar......as this deal is going to end...,3
I have ordered it.... Just waiting for the delivery.... It's already 5 days.... M excited to get my first learning guitar....It's over from the delivery dates... But still i m unable to get my product...... The delivery is much slow....,2
"The guitar was awesome...I'm not a pro guitarist ,I just bought one to practice on my own...for my need it fulfilled extraordinarily...but if u are opting to go for classes...they prefer you to buy a guitar of higher prices...If you are a person who just want to know what's a guitar..and want to get the feel of it means this is for you..",5
"Our first guitar pack delivered so light packing and loose strings and one string broken and hanging around. Most importantly the guitar weight is so light and paint was not up to mark, ofcourse since it's cheaper for beginners strings in both ends are the worst mechanism never ever pick up if you are first time user.",1
The product is fine for beginners..and quite good  at this rate only issue is its all out of tune and one of my string is rusted,4
"The product is damaged. I had purchased this to gift my brother, but the damaged product shocked us and embarrassed us when opened on his birthday... This is not expected from Amazon",1
Not worth for this rate. We can even get Givson brand for this,3
"Packaging is good. All accessories are in good condition, no scratches on guitar problem is rust on string. You need to tuned it yourself.Little bit smaller than standard size.Early delivered. Enjoy Tuning.😊",4
"Product missing , the Guitar cover was not given wherein shown as a part of the product this is unethical",1
It's only for photos shooting totally money wastages very hard to learn guitar for biggners and loss of interest of music,1
"I got this from oneshop, didn't like much",3
The product is a pain. Not sure why this sub standard product is even listed. See a few more users of this guitar. Small as a toy.Others in this price range could be better.,1
This product is awesome....it looks stylish and is most appropriate for a beginner by considering the price....thanku soo much amazon❤.,5
"Many guitar are defective , minor broken🙁🙁🙁🙁🙁🙁🙁🙁.I return 3 timesSo please check clearly after buying .. . .",1
Not worth it ..the sound as well as the wood quality is terrible. Total waste of money . Also needs to be tuned every time before use ....,1
It was really bad choice to buy it. When i open the package it was not in good condition..one string is broken... 😒😒,1
Its a good guitar at a very reasonable price too but i think the wood used in this guitar is of cheap quality.,4
"Guitar at this price didn't expected much but when I received the product it was beyond my expectations 😍I'm very happy and satisfied ,love the packagingIt's good for beginnersSounds very good you just need to adjust the strings first. Thankyou Amazon❤❤",5
"I sincerely don't know if it's good for beginners, but yes, it's cheap. The piece i received was in good shape when received. But when i tried tuning the guitar one of the keys gave away. So the guitar could not be tuned. Unfortunately I had crossed the returning deadline. Now i am stuck with a unrepairable piece. Also there is no guarantee as such from the manufacturer. So before buying take these points into consideration.",1
Nice Guitar & prompt delivery as per schedule. Value for money product.,5
"If you're looking for a guitar to start your journey of music, THIS IS IT..!!Super fast delivery from Amazon.1 string was not getting tuned, but I'm sure everything will be fine once the guitar gets a few months old.P.S. For tuning, use GuitarTuna app!",4
For beginners it's very nice. I am loving it ☺️,5

"Nothing could be better than this, in this price.",5
"Very high action, average build quality. Almost impossible to play for beginners. Spend couple of grands more and go for a better guitar.",1
Waste of money buy other brand guitar it is cheap and local mg yamaha fender givson are some good brands,1
This is the worst product. Dont buy it. I have to apply a large amount of pressure just for it to work like a normal guitar. Now my hands are hurting and the guitar sounds like crap. Had to change the string 3times. Dont but this crap,1
Pathetic guitar...don't buy it.Always learn on a good guitar ...invest more for a good guitar good sound for learning.,1
"This is a showpiece. Never try to play it. I don't consider this as real guitar. Buy something good, spend money else don't buy.",1
It's cost me a lot as compare to today so i want to replace it,4
"Recvd my guitar today only. It is for my 11 yr old daughter who has just started learning guitar. She is very happy with product as she says it is as good as they get in school for learning. Color, finish, material everything is good at this price. Will review again after using it for few months.",5
I get this guitar today and i have something to share about this product looks are good but the quality of sound it give is terrifying so better to thing before buying this guitar and more worst than that we can't get refund from this product only replacement,2
This product costs the same in non-sale days. Where is 69% off???? What a way to loot!!Increase the price to your wish and offer a 69% off.. hahahaha,1

Best for beginners..... Worth the price,5
Worst product I ever seen very very bad please don’t buy it worst of money 😡🤯 don’t waste your money in it,1
Great Value for money bought it on the prime day.,4
"The guitar is in perfect condition! Much recommended for begginers, quality is good, and at 2000 rs can't expect more of it!!  But one thing I feel is it has to be tuned every twice time I use (with the help of an app)  but yeah worth ur money! Must buy",5
Good one in this price,3
Its sooo good beginners.(Guitar body little scraches 😠,3
The product is damaged .. I have raise the request for replacement .please replace the item at earliest. This is really disappointing.Please replace the item ASAP.,1
The wooden finish ensures that the guitar it is not only durable but is designed as well. This is glossy finish and best sound quality. This guiter is easy to hold and light weight.,5
It is amazing,5
Nice guitar with good sound and body ...Great packing but the body has small small 5-6 damages which r covered by paint ... And picks broke in just 2 days... But it's ithe guitar that matters the most which is awesome... Should buy this,4
"Extremely helpful, easy and convenient to use.",5
Everything at this price💯💯💯💯,5
That's  Really Good..I love it.I'm Very Happy with Buying this product.♥️♥️♥️,5
It's a nice guitar for beginners like me ...and their is not any sound error all chords play properly,5
"Please Don't buy this guitar very baad wood quality, strings are very bad they break easily, the guitar is of a medium size acoustic guitar body with the handle of a classical guitar so it is not good for beginners as classical guitar handles are much wider and hard to play",1
Don't think to much if you are a beginner then just go for it,5
"Very average guitar, don't expect too much,u can consider something is better than nothing for this price,I don't recommend this for beginners because they fed up very hard to play,and one big issue if you tune D,A,E string it starts to get crack , never recommend at all.",1
Awesome product great quality ...Awesome sound ! Must buy at this point range this is upto professional type !,5
Totally DisappointedIt was nothing as shown in the pictures. I ordered for a black colored guitar and recived an orange color one.,1
"GOT THE PRODUCT BEFORE 2 DAYS OF DELIVERY DATE AND THE PACKAGING WAS JUST  OUTSTANDING LIKE THE GUITAR WAS FULLY SAFE.WHAT WAS INSIDE THE BOX.1.MANY AIR PACKETS TO PROTECT THE GUITAR.2.A SMALL BOX INSIDE THE BIG BOX.3. GUITAR4.A GUITAR BAG5. INSIDE OF THE BAG THERE WAS EXTRA STRINGS,2 Picks and a guitar strap which got broken in just a second.OVERALL THE PRODUCT IS AWESOME IN THIS PRICE I RECOMMEND TO BUY THIS IF YOU ARE BUYING FIRST TIME.THANKS AND PEACE OUT.",5
